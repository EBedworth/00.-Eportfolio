										<h3 class="major">The MSc Capstone Project</h3>
										<p>
											The MSc Computer Science Project marks the final piece of work for the MSc pathway, and serves as an opportunity to present
											a combination of the skills and knowledge gained throughout the period of study. The project comprises of an undertaking of 
											practical work, resulting in the creation of one or more artefacts, as well as a 12,000 word dissertation, acting as a comprehensive
											report of the activity. In proposing my project to the university, I was also required to provide justification that the research 
											conducted during the project provided valuable contribution to the field by identifying the gaps in literature which this project would 
											fill. 
										</p>
										<p>
											As a master's-level project, additional requirements are placed on the student when undertaking the necessary activities. Specifically, 
											the master's student is required to demonstrate systematic understanding of the specialist academic discipline, as well as current problems, 
											developments or changes in the domain of knowledge. Paramount to master's-level study is criticality, meaning the student is required to 
											think critically about existing research (or lack of), and provide clear criticism where it is identified as necessary. This criticality 
											also extends to the student, and critical self-evaluation throughout the project (and entire MSc course) is strongly encouraged.											
										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Sustainable production lines in the era of Industry 5.0 - A reinforcement learning approach</h3>
										<p>
											My project, titled <i>Sustainable production lines in the era of Industry 5.0 - A reinforcement learning approach</i>, explored the use of 
											an autonomous agent, trained using reinforcement learning, to reduce the energy consumption of a production line. The agent, having been trained 
											on many previous hours of production runs, took control of a key routing decision within the line, directing products with the aim of minimising 
											the total energy consumption of the line per unit produced. The production line itself was simulated, built in a discrete-event simulation software
											package called FlexSim. The simulation was designed with consideration to real-world production environments, with randomness and imperfect conditions
											modelled in. 
										</p>
										<p>
											There were several motivating factors for me in undertaking this project. Firstly, my experience in industrial environments, and understanding of 
											the opportunities for emerging technologies within manufacturing facilities which often remain largely unchanged for decades. Through my reseach into 
											the application of machine learning in these environments, I had identified that reduction of energy consumption, particularly with regards to existing 
											facilities, was not well-explored. In addition to this, reinforcement learning as was underrepresented in the researchm compared to supervised learning 
											approaches. This stood out to me as a great opportunity, given the hugely dynamic environments involved in manufacturing. It seemed natural to me that 
											a reinforcement learning approach could excel where supervised learning was not easy to implement, given the innumerable variables throughout a production
											system. Finally, the emergence of the idea of 'Industry 5.0', as a driving force for sustainable, human-first manufacturing, provided further motivation 
											for this research. Although given my own experience with Industry 4.0, which I feel has been as much of a marketing exercise for component manufacturers 
											as it has been a true industrial revolution, I believe in the critical importance of the three pillars of Industry 5.0 - human-centricity, sustainability, 
											resilience - to the future of humanity. This 'rebrand' of Industry 4.0, again debatable as a true industrial revolution, should be encouraged and supported, 
											and one way to achieve this is by conducting research into the real impact that emerging technologies can have on industry.
										</p>
										<p>
											The result of the research shows a consistent improvement in energy consumption in the simulation runs where the autonomous agent controls the flow of 
											production. I summarised my project in my 12,000 word dissertation, and also delivered a presentation on the project activities and results, where I was 
											required to defend against criticism. This final presentation can be seen below.

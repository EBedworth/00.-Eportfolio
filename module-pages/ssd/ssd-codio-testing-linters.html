								<h2>Exploring Linters</h2>
                                <p>
									In Unit 6, we were asked to run some Python tools which check our code for linters (stylistic errors) and comment on the 
                                    output of these tools, focusing on how useful this output was to improving our code.
                                </p>

									<h3 class="major">Testing Tools</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Two tools were to be used for testing our example code during this exercise. The tools were:
                                        <li>PyLint</li>
                                        <li>Flake8</li>
										<br>
                                        Were provided with some sample Python files to test our code, and asked to comment on the output from our testing tools and then to 
                                        fix these files.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>styleLint.py</h4>
                                    <p>
										Our first file was styleLint.py, formatted as below:
                                        <pre><code>
def factorial(n):
""" Return factorial of n """
if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n*factorial(n-1)   
                                        </code></pre>
										When this code was run with Python, an indentation error was returned. In order to fix this, the indentation was corrected as follows:
										<br>
										<br>
										<pre><code>
def factorial(n):
""" Return factorial of n """
if n == 0:
	return 1
else:
	return n*factorial(n-1)
										</code></pre>
                                    </p>
									<h4>pylintTest.py</h4>
									<p>
										We were then asked to run both PyLint and Flake8 on the following file (pylintTest.py):
										<pre><code>

# SOURCE OF CODE: https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/tutorial.html

import string
 
shift = 3
choice = raw_input("would you like to encode or decode?")
word = (raw_input("Please enter text"))
letters = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits
encoded = ''
if choice == "encode":
  for letter in word:
    if letter == ' ':
      encoded = encoded + ' '
    else:
      x = letters.index(letter) + shift
      encoded=encoded + letters[x]
    if choice == "decode":
      for letter in word:
        if letter == ' ':
            encoded = encoded + ' '
        else:
          x = letters.index(letter) - shift
          encoded = encoded + letters[x]

print encoded
										</code></pre>
										When this code was tested with PyLint, the following output was returned: 
										<br>

Your code has been rated at -2.63/10 (previous run: -2.63/10, +0.00)

										</code></pre>
										And when testing with Flake8, the output was: 
										<br>
										<br>
										<pre><code>
pylintTest.py:5:1: W293 blank line contains whitespace

										</code></pre>
									</p>
									<h4>Pylint and Flake8 Comparison</h4>
									<p>
										The output from PyLint was more detailed than the output from Flake8, which would allow us to improve our code to a greater degree. Some 
										errors were omitted from Flake8, such as the 'invalid-name' errors which are shown for the global variables in the file. However, the 
										PyLint error for these global variables is not necessarily correct (and is not correct in this case) as PyLint is considering all of 
										the variables outside of the main body to be constants. Some the variables in this file are not constants, but are still globals. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In addition, Flake8 did not detect the style of the filename, the missing docstring, or the redefined outer name. 
									</p>
									<p>
										It appears to me that PyLint is perhaps more detailed in the checks it performs, however, I would expect that each error received from 
										PyLint should be scrutinised by the programmer, rather than immediately changed. There are some examples of the output above which should
										not be changed, based on the output of PyLint. While Flake8 is less detailed, this perhaps means that the changes suggested are obvious 
										and should require less scrutiny. 
									</p>
									<h4>Corrected Files</h4>
									<p>
										Following the output from both testing tools, I proceeded to correct the file as required.
										<pre><code>
""" # SOURCE OF CODE: https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/tutorial.html
"""
import string

SHIFT = 3
CHOICE = raw_input("would you like to encode or decode?")
WORD = (raw_input("Please enter text"))
LETTERS = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits
ENCODED = ''
if CHOICE == "encode":
    for letter in WORD:
        if letter == ' ':
            ENCODED = ENCODED + ' '
        else:
            x = LETTERS.index(letter) + SHIFT
            ENCODED = ENCODED + LETTERS[x]
if CHOICE == "decode":
    for letter in WORD:
        if letter == ' ':
            ENCODED = ENCODED + ' '
        else:
            x = LETTERS.index(letter) - SHIFT
            ENCODED = ENCODED + LETTERS[x]

print(ENCODED)

										</code></pre>
										Note that for the above, I changed the file to satisfy the requirements of PyLint, however, there are now some capitalised non-constant 
										variables. This is not a good choice stylistically, and so should not have been implemented.

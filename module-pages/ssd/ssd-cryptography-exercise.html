								<h2>Cryptography Programming Exercise</h2>
                                <p>
									In Unit 8, we were tasked with creating a Python program which takes a text file, encrypts the data the file, then writes the data
                                    to a new file.

									<h3 class="major">My Implementation</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I chose to use the AES encryption algorithm to implement the brief for this exercise. The main reason that I chose AES here was 
                                        because we had elected to use the AES algorithm for our assessed work for this module. Exapnding on this, the reason that we chose
                                        the AES algorithm for our assessed work was due to AES being widely accepted as currently the most secure encryption method widely 
                                        available and reasonably usable. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are several examples available online for implementing the AES encryption algorithm in Python. I selected an implementation which 
                                        fitted the requirement to encrypt data from a text file, as opposed to encrypting a bytes object. I could equally have used byte object 
                                        encryption, but this would also have required additional steps in my program to convert the data from the text file from a string to 
                                        bytes, and I felt as though such an implementation could become unnecessarily messy. The implementation which I used also follows an 
                                        object-oriented approach, which I felt was relevant to the overall MSc course so far and in-keeping with the software I have been 
                                        writing so far. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As well as defining the AESCipher object, my program makes use of the Python sys library to accept arguments from the user when executing
                                        the program. In this way, the user can run the program with the paths to the input and output files, meaning that nothing needs to be 
                                        hard-coded in the program. The program will open the input file in read mode and read the data inside to a string variable. This string 
                                        variable is then passed to an instance of the AESCipher class, using the 'encrypt' method to return an encrypted string of the same data. 
                                        Finally, this encrypted string is written to a file with the path given as the second argument when running the program. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The following is my entire final implementation:
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This exercise also asked us to consider if our implementation would meet GDPR regulations. I think this is not a clear question to answer, 
                                        as GDPR is intentionally vague on specific technologies used to encrypt any data. However, I believe that the best answer is that AES 
                                        certainly would be an acceptable algorithm to use in order to encrypt data covered by the GDPR, but this implementation is clearly only 
                                        suitable for proof of concept, not for handling actual data. One example of this is the management of the secret AES key required to 
                                        encrypt and decrypt the data. In my implementation, I have a constant variable called AES_KEY which contains a key ("encryptionKey") which
                                        is then passed to my AESCipher object. In reality, this would be managed much more securely, using a more secure key with the optimal length
                                        and complexity requirements, stored externally to the software directly accessing the key.

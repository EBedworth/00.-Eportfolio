								<h2>Team Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language?</h2>

                                <p>In Unit 3, we were asked to answer three questions about secure programming languages and then discuss our 
                                    answers within our team.

                                    <h3 class="major">Question 1 - What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</h3>
									<h4>My Answer</h4>
									<p>
										Cifuentes et al. (2019) propose that a secure programming language should provide, at a language-level, protection against all prominent categories of vulnerability. 
										Specifically, these are identified as:
										<ul>
										<li>Buffer errors</li>
										<li>Injection errors</li>
										<li>Information leaks</li>
										</ul>
										I believe that for a programming language to be considered truly secure, the language itself must be designed in such a way that it could not be used to design software 
										which contains any possibility of unauthorised usage of the software or access to protected data. This goal also relies heavily on the programmer themselves, and so the 
										human factor of the language must also be a part of the evaluation of security. This would include features such as readability and maintainability providing a sufficient 
										level of abstraction for the programmer to give sufficient resource to secure development, without being overloaded. 
                                    </p>
									<h4>Other Team Members</h4>
									<p>
										Other members of my team went into more specific detail of features which might be found in a 'secure' language, which I think was valuable. Specifically mentioned by 
										multiple team members were: 
										<ul>
											<li>Memory Safety</li>
											<li>Type Safety</li>
											<li>Active Community / Ecosystem Support</li>
											<li>Effective Security Tools</li>
										</ul>
										<br>
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Question 2 - Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</h3>
									<h4>My Answer</h4>
									<p>
										In relation to the consideration of human factors of security of the language, Python does very well at providing high levels of abstraction to ensure that a programmer 
										can be focused on designing secure software. Specifically, Python is incredibly human-readable and support for an object-oriented approach to development allow easy 
										maintenance of existing software. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Programmatically too, Python provides many mitigations for known vulnerabilities in the language (Pillai, 2017). In addition to these mitigations, by design Python has 
										abstracted away from direct memory access functionality which is possible with C (which the default implementation of Python uses). This does much to prevent buffer 
										errors in particular. However, to identify and understand the implementation of the mitigations to many vulnerabilities present in Python, the programmer must have prior 
										knowledge of the vulnerability and access to sufficient external documentation to counter it. Because of this, I would not class Python as secure. Built-in language 
										components can still be used to either knowingly or unknowingly create vulnerabilities in software. If Python were truly secure, such an action should not be possible. 
										I do believe that Python does very well as a language working towards being secure, however, whilst any vulnerabilities still exist (or can exist) in modern Python 
										programs, I do not believe it correct to say that it is secure. 
									</p>
									<h4>Other Team Members</h4>
									<p>
										Where I felt that Python should not be considered a secure language, some of the other team members had different opinions. One team member felt that Python should be 
										considered as secure, due to the measures in place to address the specific points which were mentioned in question 1 (memory safety etc.). Another team member said that 
										Python was somewhat secure, but not entirely, which was closer to my own opinion. We discussed these differences in our group chat.

									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Question 3 - Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</h3>
									<h4>My Answer</h4>
									<p>
										From a secure programming perspective, Python would offer some advantages when developing software as complex as an operating system. As previously mentioned, abstraction 
										away from memory allocation/deallocation alongside human readability would likely provide an easily maintainable system with few opportunities for buffer overflow errors.
										<br>
										<br>
										However, some of the factors which make Python a good language in regards to security also make it an inferior language to create an operating system in, when compared to 
										a language such as C. These abstractions away from memory manipulation are useful for software applications which have no need for direct memory access, but the operating 
										system does not fall into this category. Memory management is in fact one of the key roles of the operating system, and something which Python provides little access to 
										or visibility of. Whilst Python relies on C to allocate memory, the increased overheads this requires would impact the performance of an operating system (Cifuentes & 
										Bierman, 2019). 
									</p>
									<h4>Other Team Members</h4>
									<p>
										For this question, the whole team felt that Python would not be the best choice of language for building an operating system. Something interesting which was raised was 
										the idea that Python could be used to build components or tools within an operating system, particularly where the more secure features, when compared to lower-level 
										languages, could be useful.

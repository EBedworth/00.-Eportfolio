								<h2>Exploring a Simple Python Shell</h2>
                                <p>
									In Unit 7, we were asked to read two blogs which described different implementations of a shell/CLI built using Python. We were then 
                                    tasked with implementing our own version.

                                    <h4>Danish Praka's (2018) Method</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The <a href="https://danishpraka.sh/posts/shell-in-python/">first blog was written by Praka</a> (2018) and outlined a simple Python 
                                        shell which also accommodated piping. The shell which was developed in this blog was written with a Linux operating system in mind 
                                        and provided some simple functionality for navigating and modifying files. It was useful to see how certain Python libraries could 
                                        be used to achieve the functionality required for this implementation. The use of the OS library in Python provides an easy way to 
                                        navigate through directories, while the subprocess library provides a host of system commands which are familiar to those who are 
                                        used to using the standard Linux shell.

                                    <h4>Gabor Szabo's method</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <a href="https://code-maven.com/interactive-shell-with-cmd-in-python">Szabo's method</a> introduced a simpler but less-flexible 
                                        implementation of a Python CLI. The implementation appeared to be more operating system agnostic, meaning the implementation could be the 
                                        same for multiple operating systems. However, Szabo's implementation was not written to perform actual operations within the computer 
                                        environment, but to provide the framework for a developer to build from, specifying further what each defined operation should do. 
                                        Szabo makes use of the Python cmd library, which provides the functionality for the terminal to operate as the CLI does.

                                        My own implementation more closely followed Szabo's method. As the exercise required us to implement some specific 
                                        functionality attached to a command word, I felt as though building on the framework from Szabo allowed me to do this most 
                                        effectively. The following section shows the code for my completed shell.

                                    <h3 class="major">Exercise Questions</h3>
                                    <h4>What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell? </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        One potential vulnerability is sharing the contents of the working directory freely with the LIST command. This may expose sensitive 
                                        information, depending on the context in which the shell is being run. The second vulnerability I managed to find occurs if a very 
                                        large input string is entered into the command line. I pasted an 86000 letter string into the shell and there was a wait time of a few 
                                        seconds after hitting enter, then nothing was returned from the shell, even the default message which should be printed. Presumably 
                                        this could cause a denial of service, given a long enough string. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell? </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I would implement some behaviour to check the length of the input string and prevent very large strings being entered. After some 
                                        research, I have found that some functionality close to this is possible by using the ‘precmd’ method which is included with the Cmd 
                                        class. A large input string still causes a pause, however, I was able to enforce and error message and return from the shell before 
                                        any execution was attempted. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Provide a code example of changes which would improve the security of the shell. </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        My implementation of precmd can be seen below: 
                                        <pre><code>
def precmd(self, inp: str) -> str:
    if len(inp) > 100:
        print("String too long!")
        return self.do_exit(inp)
    
    return super().precmd(inp)
                                        </code></pre>
                                    </p>

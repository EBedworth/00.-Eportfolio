                                <p>
									In Unit 10, we were instructed to read the article by Schmitz et al. (2016) regarding Faceted Data. We were then asked to comment on how 
                                    good of an approach the idea is, and to outline how we would implement such an approach in Python.

                                    <h4>Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and cons?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I would not say definitively that faceted data is either a good or bad approach to preventing data leakage, but rather that there 
                                        are both pros and cons of such an approach which should be considered when comparing to other related methods. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Faceted data is, by design, used to protect against the accidental leaking of data. By encapsulating data in 'facets', with public
                                        and private views, the structure of data storage is well considered and designed with the prevention of such leakage in mind. This 
                                        encourages the development of 'safe' software (with regards to data leakage), which is obviously a beneficial attribute.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to this, by defining the structure of data such that sensitive data cannot be leaked, it removes complexity through 
                                        any variation which might otherwise be present in the storing and processing of data. This ensures that a system where faceted data
                                        is applied will be consistent and should be safe from data-leakage throughout. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Negative aspects may be encountered when a system using faceted data must interact with one which does not. I would expect this to be
                                        quite a likely scenario, given that many systems which process sensitive user data must interact with external services such as payment
                                        systems and booking databases, to name a few. Where facted data is used in one part of a chain of systems, maintaining consistency in the 
                                        private and public data could prove challenging, and this data will also presumably become 'unfaceted' once it has left the originating 
                                        system. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It should also be noted that the article focuses mostly on using faceted data in Haskell, which has certain attributes as a language which 
                                        may not necessarily translate to other languages. For example, Haskell is entirely functional and is generally a compiled language, as 
                                        opposed to Python which is an object-oriented and interpreted language. Although the article does consider interpreted languages, it may 
                                        be the case that faceted data is less practical in these languages.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Create a basic outline design of how you would create such a system in Python</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        To implement this approach in Python, I would use private class attributes to prevent access to the private data, and create non-private 
                                        attributes for the public data. Using this method, we could create appropriate methods in each class (each type of data we will store) 
                                        for allowing access to the correct level of data as defined. 
                                    </p>

                                        Below is a brief overview of how this might look:

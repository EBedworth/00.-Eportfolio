								<h2>Blog Post</h2>

                                <p>For Unit 2, we were asked to write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks
                                    from the inside, based on five words which we would select from the ISO/IEC 27000 Section 3 - Terms and Definitions. 
                                    My submitted blog post can be seen below.

                                        <br>
                                        <h4>Friday, 17 November 2023, 6:28 PM
                                        by Elliot Bedworth</h4>
                                        <br>
                                        Cyber security is a constant, ongoing threat to organisations of all sizes. Whilst prioritisation of cyber security 
                                        has generally increased over the last decade (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2023), the ever-evolving 
                                        nature of cyber security means that threats continue to exist. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Whilst technological challenges evolve, the part that people play remains, to some degree, a consistent part of the cyber 
                                        security chain. Where some research has tried to quantify the risk introduced through human factors on cyber security 
                                        (Evans et al., 2016), very many sources agree on the significant role which people play in the introduction of cyber security 
                                        risks. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Below, we will explore some of the terms from ISO/IEC 27000:2018, relating to information security techniques, and see how 
                                        they might be applied to the management of people in order to mitigate some of the cyber security risks which organisations face.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>Organisation</h3>
                                        Organisations of all different sizes and structures face cyber security challenges (Department for Science, Innovation and 
                                        Technology, 2023). As such, there is likely no 'one size fits all' solution in regards to organisational changes which can impact 
                                        the human factors of cyber security. However, there are still common recommendations which transcend size or structure. Some research 
                                        has found that factors such as the perceived level of ethics of an organisation can increase the likelihood that an employee will 
                                        comply with IT policy and thus reduce the chance of that employee introducing risk (Kim & Han, 2018). 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>Policy</h3>
                                        Employee compliance to IT policy is not valuable, unless the policy is well designed. Some areas of focus here should be on the 
                                        indirect aspects of such a policy: how it relates to the employees and the long-term goals achieved by implementing such a policy 
                                        (Höne & Eloff, 2022). 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>Top Management</h3>
                                        Cultural shifts within a business are most effectively conducted when delivered from the top. Although a large proportion of businesses 
                                        have adopted the approach of assigning specific, director-level leaders as responsible for cyber security, the level of buy-in should 
                                        be extended further still to include the entire board as equally responsible and knowledgeable about the threats which exist. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>Continual Improvement</h3>
                                        To stand a chance against the changing state-of-play that is cyber security, individuals must accept a culture of continual improvement 
                                        and be motivated to complete training and learn the new risks which arise in a timely fashion. This responsibility ultimately lies 
                                        with the organisations who demand the training be completed, who must ensure that employees do not disengage through such phenomena as 
                                        'Cyber Fatigue' (Reeves et al., 2021).

                                        <h3>Review</h3>
                                        None of the above steps are possible without effective review and reflection. As with any formal learning, review is a crucial stage 
                                        in ensuring that people, policy and practice are current and fit for purpose. Reviews should be organised and undertaken at regular, 
                                        defined intervals against a set of criteria which allow objective and useful revision to take place.

								<h2>Cyclomatic Complexity</h2>
                                <p>
									The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, 
                                    should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure 
                                    software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.

									<h3 class="major">Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity's Relevance Today</h3>
                                    <p>
										Cyclomatic complexity remains an important metric in the development of software today. Automated testing tools, such as PyLint 
                                        and flake8, include tests for cyclomatic complexity as part of their evaluation of software and companies continue to rely on the 
                                        metric for evaluation of products which they send to market (Ebert et al., 2016). For industry, specifically, to persevere in 
                                        valuing cyclomatic complexity indicates that there is some perceived value in measuring it. 
									</p>
									<p>
										It is apparent, when reviewing academic literature on the subject of cyclomatic complexity, that there are many who disagree with that 
                                        perception of value. Almost since its proposal in the 1970s (McCabe, 1976), critiques of the approach, particularly in terms of cases 
                                        which can be missed (Shepperd, 1988), have existed. Whilst it has been documented and proven that such limitations exist within McCabe’s 
                                        method for measuring cyclomatic complexity, I believe that it is most important to consider pragmatically if value is gained or lost 
                                        from its use. 
									</p>
									<p>
										To consider practical value, it is useful to start with a more general question than to examine how closely cyclomatic complexity performs 
                                        to its intended purpose. I believe that the question: ‘does cyclomatic complexity influence the development of software positively or 
                                        negatively?’ is one such practical question. To explore the answer to this, it is useful to have some metric of software quality to 
                                        reference, for which the most suitable candidate, in this case, would be the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, subtitled ‘Systems and software Quality 
                                        Requirements and Evaluation’ (ISO, 2017). However, for brevity and contextual relevance, I have considered the six architectural quality 
                                        attributes listed in the course text (Pillai, 2017): modifiability, testability, scalability and performance, availability, security, and 
                                        deployability. 
									</p>
									<h4>Modifiability</h4>
									<p>
										Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of possible paths through a given element of software. By measuring this complexity, and 
                                        striving for a low measured value, the number of available paths must be reduced. I believe that complexity is the attribute where most 
                                        improvement can be made by using cyclomatic complexity as a metric, as this natural reduction in possible paths through software elements 
                                        naturally encourages the development of more, but smaller, software elements. This means that changes are easily made without risk of 
                                        accidental impact to the wider system (assuming well designed software). 
									</p>
                                    <h4>Testability</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Pillai (2017) defines testability as ‘how much a software system is amenable to demonstrating its faults through testing’. If we apply 
                                        this definition to an element of software which does not consider cyclomatic complexity (and so can have a very large number of processes 
                                        between input and output), it is reasonable to think that either some faults may go unnoticed (because certain areas of the software are 
                                        not tested) or that many tests may need to be developed (to ensure the former does not occur). In this way, the metric of cyclomatic 
                                        complexity again adds considerable value, enabling clear and concise testing to be carried out. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Scalability and Performance</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I believe that scalability and performance is not significantly improved by measuring cyclomatic complexity. It could be argued that the 
                                        application of cyclomatic complexity metrics lead to programs with slightly more overheads than those where it is not implied, which would 
                                        in turn have a slightly negative impact on performance, especially when scaling. However, I do believe the benefits far outweigh this 
                                        situation. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Availability</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Improvements in availability can be indirectly linked to low cyclomatic complexity. Through the development of simpler and more easily 
                                        maintainable software, availability would be expected to increase. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Security</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I believe that security is clearly improved, but again indirectly. Testability, maintainability and availability all directly impact 
                                        security and I believe, as discussed previously, that low cyclomatic complexity improves these attributes. An interesting consideration is 
                                        that a simple program may be easier for an attacker to understand and, in turn, exploit. However, the simplicity of a program also leaves 
                                        far less room for exploitations to be missed by developers, so this may be naturally counteracted. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Deployability</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The tendency for low cyclomatic complexity to be found in more modular software also improves deployability. Maintainability is also 
                                        improved by this characteristic, which becomes important following deployment. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Considering the above attributes, I believe that, overall, cyclomatic complexity is a metric which drives improvement towards ‘better’ 
                                        software, when evaluated against standardised quality attributes. Whilst I appreciate that cyclomatic complexity is not a perfect 
                                        measurement of all types of complexity, I believe that it still plays a valuable role in identifying software which is too complex and 
                                        could be improved. One particular characteristic of cyclomatic complexity which I feel makes it a useful tool is its simplicity and, by 
                                        extension, its practicality. This simplicity means that it is easy for automated tools to calculate and to produce an output which a 
                                        developer can quickly understand and use to improve their code, which is, broadly speaking, the whole point of testing at all.

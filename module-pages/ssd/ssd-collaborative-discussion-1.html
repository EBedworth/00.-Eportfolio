								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1</h2>

                                <p> Our first collaborative discussion, started in Unit 1, was to select a weakness identified by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)
                                    from their <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank">Top Ten List</a> and present a flowchart detailing which steps may have 
                                    led to the weaknesses occurring.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I have selected the number one item from the OWASP Top Ten list to explore: Broken Access Control (OWASP, 2021). 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Broken Access Control covers any possible occurrence of access to either data or functionality which should not be possible due to user privilege 
                                        requirements. The obvious examples of this include a user being able to access the account of another user, or modification of data by a 
                                        non-authorised user which should be reserved for those with administrator privileges. Beyond this, Broken Access Control also covers users being 
                                        permitted to access certain data or functionality which is not strictly necessary, known as the principle of least privilege. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I have used an activity diagram to indicate the flow of activity which may occur prior to identifying a failure through Broken Access Control. 
                                        I believe this is the most suitable way to present this information as it presents a logical sequence of operation, which is easily interpreted, 
                                        and does not focus on the technical details of how each action might be carried out, which is beyond the scope of this question.

                                    <h3 class="major">Feedback and Other Posts</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Following my initial post, I received feedback from several of my peers on the diagram I had made. It seemed that my diagram was clear and presented 
										the problem of Broken Access Control in an effective way, so that others were able to understand the sequence of events which may lead to a vulnerability
										being exposed. Some criticism that I received was that the use of swim lanes would be an improvement, as it would show more clearly which actors each 
										activity was relevant to. I believe this is good feedback, and I think that including swim lanes would have increased the clarity of my diagram further. 
                                    </p>
									<p>
										I also reviewed and commented on some of my peers' diagrams. Something which was interesting to me was the choice to use sequence diagrams over activity 
										diagrams (as I had chosen). On reviewing the other posts and considering the feedback on my own post, I could see the benefit of doing this. The sequence 
										diagram is structured with swim lanes by default, showing the different actors and the interaction between them. For issues related to cyber security, this
										is a good choice, as it clearly shows the interaction between threat actor and victim or vulnerable system. However, I do feel as though some detail is lost
										through the use of sequence diagrams. It can become unclear which actions are expected and which are not, and it is particularly difficult to identify where 
										the problem that exposes a vulnerability is located within a system. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I concluded this discussion forum with a summary post, covering what I had learned from the feedback I received and the work of my peers:

											<br>
											<br>
											Having read through the posts of my peers and also having received feedback on my own post, I have found the different approaches used 
											to visualise the chosen vulnerabilities interesting. I selected a UML activity diagram to show the flow of actions which may lead to my chosen 
											vulnerability as I felt that the structure was most similar to a flowchart, and allowed me to represent different paths which may be followed, 
											including those which expose the vulnerability. However, most of my peers selected sequence diagrams to show the interactions between the different 
											objects involved in the vulnerabilities they had selected. 
											<br>
											<br>
											I can see the merit in using a sequence diagram for this task, as the mapping of events over time gives a clear impression of the sequence of 
											events which take place and lead to a vulnerability occurring. However, I also feel that it is difficult to present a high degree of detail using a 
											sequence diagram, and perhaps some of the meaning is not well presented as it is compressed into a general statement 'vulnerability occurs' without 
											understanding how or why. On the other hand, I felt that I was able to show more detailed steps with an activity diagram, but also struggled to present 
											which actors were performing which roles and where they were situated relative to the vulnerable system. One suggestion for improving this was to use 
											swim lanes, which I could see improving the information presented in my diagram.

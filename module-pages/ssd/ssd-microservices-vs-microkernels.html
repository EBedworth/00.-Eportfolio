								<h2>Microservices vs Microkernels Debate</h2>
                                <p>
									In Unit 11, we were asked to pick a side in the 'Microservices vs Microkernels' debate (DiBona & Ockman, 1999) and post our justification. 
                                    In Unit 12, we had to defend our position against an opposing one.

                                            <p>
                                                Although he point being made that 'microservices and microkernels are the future' may appear to be correct, the prevalence of microservice 
                                                architecture does not not exist exclusively from monolithic architecture. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Driven by the increasing demand to maintain large software systems across diverse teams, the application of microservices in software 
                                                development can be considered a modernisation of legacy application development (Escobar et al., 2016). This trend towards creating an 
                                                increased amount of smaller components is also observed in other areas of software development, such as in the object-oriented programming 
                                                paradigm, or through the usage of Agile workflows (Chen et al., 2017). It is logical, then, that more frequent use of a microservice or 
                                                microkernel architecture should be observed, as the working practices of software teams develop in a similar way. 
                                            </p>
                                            <P>
                                                There are few advantages that could reasonably be argued for monolithic architecture over microservice architecture, however, those few will 
                                                still serve niche applications where they apply. For very simple, isolated systems, monolithic architecture remains easy (and cheap) to design, 
                                                build and run for a long period of time. For applications where interfacing to external services is not possible, monolithic architecture may 
                                                remain the only choice, something which is also prevalent in certain areas of industry. 
                                            </P>
                                            <p>
                                                I believe that whilst a continuing increase in the application of microservice and microkernel architecture is likely, this does not mean that 
                                                monolithic architecture will be completely replaced. It should also be considered, in the context of the debate, that Linux is still a widely 
                                                used operating system whilst remaining monolithic. I believe the idea of coexistence is too quickly dismissed by agreeing with either side of 
                                                this debate, and think that this is the most likely outcome for the future.

                                        As a team, we had very similar positions on this argument even before discussing with each other. We all felt that microservice architecture is prevalent 
                                        as the architecture of choice for the majority of new systems, however, we also do not think that this will lead to the extinction of monolithic systems. 
                                        As discussed in my own post, there still exists some niche use-cases for monolithic systems. Looking to Linux as an example of such a system, the wide 
                                        existing usage of Linux is unlikely to disappear, and although it is possible that Linux is 'modernised' into a microservice architecture, we believe that 
                                        such systems will never be completely 'lost' to those systems which surplant them. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although there were no opposing arguments in the forum, I would argue that it is an oversimplification to claim that because one architecture has overtaken 
                                        the other in popularity, that the other architecture is obsolete and has no future.
                                    </p>

								<h2>Developing an API for a Distributed Environment</h2>
                                <p>
									In Unit 9, we were asked to run some existing code for creating an API. We were asked to to answer some questions on the functionality of 
                                    the API and then to create an API based around our assessed work which will be submitted in Unit 11.

                                    <p>
                                        We were initially provided with some code to create an API running on the Flask framework for Python web applications. The code we were 
                                        provided actually was quite challenging to run successfully with the instructions provided, something which I have addressed in the 
                                        answers to my questions below. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Exercise Questions</h3>
                                    <h4>Run the api.py code. Take a screenshot of the terminal output. What command did you use to compile and run the code?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The first command I had to use was ‘pip install –user flask’. This was required because flask does not come installed by default with 
                                        Jupyter Notebook, so it must be installed as the code uses the flask module. --user was necessary as we do not have the necessary 
                                        permissions to install flask, so --user allows us to make the installation just within our user space. I had to follow the same procedure 
                                        to install flask_restful.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>    
                                        After these had been installed, I ran ‘python3 API.py’ to run the code. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/flask-API-q1.png">
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Run the following command at the terminal prompt: w3m http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Ann. What happens when this command is run and why?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This part of the exercise is where I began encountering issues when following the instructions. The command above does nothing when entered in the 
                                        terminal prompt which is being used to run flask. It seemed as though this particular exercise was missing some fundamental information, as we were 
                                        instructed to run these commands in our Codio Jupyter Workbook workspace, but the exercise does not work correctly by doing so. The source article 
                                        for the code is also behind a paywall (on Medium), so it was not possible to check what information was missing. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To get some sensible results, I created a virtual environment in Python from my terminal in VSCode. I used the command ‘python -m venv .venv’. This 
                                        created a Python virtual environment (or venv) called .venv in my root directory. I activated the virtual environment by running the command 
                                        ‘.venv\Scripts\activate’. Activating the virtual environment allowed me to install Python packages (such as Flask) without being concerned about installing 
                                        many different packages alongside my base Python installation. From here, I used pip to install flask and flask_restful in my virtual environment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I then ran the API.py code from within my virtual environment. The w3m command which we were asked to run returned an error as not recognised. After some 
                                        research, it seems w3m is a text-based browser which requires a further installation, although perhaps is included by default on Linux systems. Either way, 
                                        I entered the URL pointing at localhost directly into Google Chrome. The result was the following in Chrome: 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/flask-API-q2-1.png">
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And in my terminal (still running the flask application), the following was shown: 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/flask-API-q2-2.png">
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What is happening here is that in Chrome, I am requesting access to the user object with the name Ann. Chrome has returned this to me by using the Get method 
                                        of the User class in the flask application running on localhost. In the Get method, the user “Ann” is found in the loop, so the corresponding data is returned.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Run the following command at the terminal prompt: w3m http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Adam. What happens when this command is run and why?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        When this command is run, Chrome returns the following: 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/flask-API-q3-1.png">
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And the following is shown in the terminal: 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/flask-API-q3-2.png">
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As before, Chrome uses the Get method of User to request the data for the user “Adam”. However, as this user does not exist, the loop completes without returning, 
                                        and the Get method instead returns the failed case of “User not found” along with a 404 code. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>What capability is achieved by the flask library?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The flask library enables creation of web applications using the Python language. This allows common web functions such as Get and Post to be configured. In this 
                                        example, we are creating a local web application running only on our machine. 
                                    </p>
                                </div>

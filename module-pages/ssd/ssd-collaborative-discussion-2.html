								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2</h2>
                                <p>
									Our second collaborative discussion, in Unit 8, was to read an analysis of the TrueCrypt encryption software by Junestam & Guigo (2014) and to 
									answer some questions on the text. We were than asked to present an ontology design which captured the weaknesses of TrueCrypt.

                                                by Elliot Bedworth - Monday, 22 January 2024, 10:29 PM
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The Open Crypto Audit Project TrueCrypt Security Assessment (Junestam & Guigo, 2014) confirms the assertion made by the TrueCrypt 
                                                authors that the TrueCrypt software is not secure. In the report, a total of 11 vulnerabilities are presented which identify 
                                                different potential surfaces where it is possible for an attack to be successfully carried out. Whilst the report makes 
                                                suggestions for short- and long-term resolutions, the discontinuation of TrueCrypt in 2014, the same year the report was released, 
                                                could suggest that these issues remained unresolved. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Because of this, I would definitely not recommend TrueCrypt as a secure storage environment. The TrueCrypt website (TrueCrypt, 2014) 
                                                contains the warning from the authors at the very top of the page, as well as providing instructions for migrating from TrueCrypt to 
                                                BitLocker, which is an alternative storage encryption application. Although the report did not identify any 'high' severity 
                                                vulnerabilities (Junestam & Guigo, 2014), and most users are unlikely to be attacked unless specifically targeted, the seriousness of 
                                                the vulnerabilities when they are exploited cannot be ignored. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Below, I have proposed an Ontology for the vulnerabilities found in TrueCrypt and the situations which might arise to users from those 
                                                vulnerabilities. The structure is not strictly adherent to normal ontology maps, which is due to the additional requirements of the 
                                                exercise to organise vulnerabilities according to severity, which is not usually a function of an ontology. However, I believe this 
                                                information is represented in my diagram. 
                                            </p>

                                        I received some feedback for my post from my peers. It was mentioned that it would be more useful if all branches of my ontology were connected 
                                        to the top-level of the heirarchy, as it was not clear where the ontology began and ended. I understand this comment, and I agree with it, but I 
                                        also feel as though the task given forced development of an unorthodox ontology as we were asked to organise the vulnerabilities according to 
                                        severity. However, I also accept that I don't feel confident in my knowledge of developing ontologies, so I need to expand my own understanding 
                                        to see how I could have implemented this one in a more recognisable structure. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I also reviewed my peers' posts and found them interesting. In particular, I felt that some of the other ontologies presented provided a good 
                                        example of how I could have formatted my own ontology better.  
                                    </p>

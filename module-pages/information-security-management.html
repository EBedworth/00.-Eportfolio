								<h2>Information Security Management</h2>
                                <p>
									Information Security Management was my sixth module for the University of Essex MSc Computer Science course. I started this
                                    6-week module on 11th June 2024.

										<h3 class="major">Module Overview</h3>
										<p>
											This module focused on security and risk in digital systems, particularly related to the protection and handling of sensitive data by organisations. 
											The module presented various traditional risk models (such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees), and continued to review hybrid models. Relevant 
											legislation, such as GDPR, is covered in detail and security standards such as PCI-DSS present considerations for distaster recovery.
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">Collaborative Discussion</h3>
										<p>
											The collaborative discussion for this module asked us to review a case study titled <i>Risks of digitisation of business models</i>, which discusses
											potential risks for organisations which are particularly driven by the advancement of Industry 4.0. This discussion was particularly relevant to my 
											own experience as an industrial automation engineer, as Industry 4.0 is a frequent topic of discussion in manufacturing. 											
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">Security Standards</h3>
										<p>
											This activity required us to read a selection of security standards - GDPR, PCI, and HIPAA. The applicability of these standards to the organisation 
											presented in the assignment for this module, and the company was evaluated against each of the standards for compliance. Hypothetical recommendations 
											were made for the company to improve compliance. 
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">GDPR Case Studies</h3>
										<p>
											Several case studies were reviewed relating to GDPR issues and breaches. We were tasked to summarise the case studies and to make recommendations on 
											how the organisation could improve their operations in order to avoid these issues.

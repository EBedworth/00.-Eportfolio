								<h2>Reflective Activity 2 - Case Study on the Inapproriate Use of Surveys</h2>

                                <p> Our second reflective activity asked us to investigate the Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal and comment on why and how it happened. We were then 
									asked to identify any other similar occurrences of the inappropriate use of survey data. 
                                </p>

										In 2018, it was revealed by a whistleblower that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the data of millions of people through the use of questionnaires 
										posted on Facebook (Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison, 2018). The data was used to build profiles on users which were later applied to events such as 
										the US election campaign and the UK Brexit referendum. The data was collected on a mass scale and most users were not informed about either collection 
										or the use of their personal data. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Much of the data collected was taken from public profiles – data which users themselves shared publicly. This is part of what made Facebook such a 
										suitable platform for data collection, as users are connected to many other users, who also have publicly available data. In this respect, Facebook 
										also share some of the blame for the scandal, as they permitted Cambridge Analytica’s app to harvest data from those who had not consented to provide 
										data to the company. 
										<br>
										<br>
										The Cambridge Analytica scandal was relatively unique, in that the data misuse was not the result of any breach of security, but was instead operating 
										as designed, making use of poor practices present in the way that Facebook operated. Data scientist Aleksandr Kogan, who was hired by Cambridge Analytica 
										to develop the app involved in the scandal, even claimed ‘Honestly we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately. We thought we were doing something 
										that was really normal.’ (Weaver, 2018). There are other examples, however, where data collected through surveys has been targeted by malicious groups and 
										effectively ‘stolen’ through hacking activities. One such event was the SurveyLama data breach, which took place in February 2024. Here, personally 
										identifiable information was stolen by hackers, affecting some four million users (Fadilpašić, 2024). Although the intended use of this data is still, to 
										this date, unknown, in the past such data breaches have ended up on the dark web for general sale. Once purchased, such data is often used for targeted 
										hacking or scamming attempts, which have a direct impact on the individuals whose data was stolen.

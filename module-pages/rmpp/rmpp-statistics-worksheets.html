                                <p> Our first collaborative discussion, started in Unit 1, was to select a <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/case-studies/" target="_blank">case study from the ACM website</a> 
									and apply the ACM Code of Ethics to the situation. We were also asked to compare our application of the code to the BCS Code of Conduct.

                                        by Elliot Bedworth - Tuesday, 6 August 2024, 8:34 PM
										<p>
											I have chosen to evaluate the case study titled 'Automatic Active Response Weaponry' (ACM, N.D.). The case study describes a defence 
											contractor whose business evolves over time, moving from production of 'passive' systems used only for protective purposes without 
											direct conflict, to more 'aggressive' systems, which proactively target threatening individuals, identified algorithmically, and 
											launching non-lethal tactical measures against them. This progression leads to several engineers leaving the company on grounds of 
											ethical concern with the intention of speaking out publicly. The company intends to respond to this by suing the engineers for breaching 
											confidentiality agreements.  
										</p>
										<p>
											The analysis of this scenario against the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ('the code') (ACM, 2018) identifies that the 
											defence contractor was in violation of several aspects of the code, particularly regarding protection of the public. There is clear 
											alignment here with the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022), where 'Public Interest' is the first principal listed. Looking beyond 
											organisations focused specifically on computer systems, these violations have severe ethical and legal implications. In this scenario, 
											given the possibility of physical harm to innocent people, and the potential for these systems to be used by government or military 
											organisations for mass-scale oppression, these violations could also be contraventions of the International Bill of Human Rights 
											(OHCHR, N.D.). In addition to this, the indiscriminate collection of personal data without permission is certain to be in violation of 
											regional legal frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR, 2016).

                                    <p>
                                        Following my initial post, I received feedback from some of peers about my application of the code. For the most part, the responses were in agreement with 
										my own evaluation, and provided some additional insight, particularly about the use of AI and the growth of technologies such as large-language models (LLM). 
										I was particularly interested in how the correct application of the code could still result in the individual being 'wrong', according to the principles which
										the code itself defined. I would have been interested to hear more about the opinions of my peers on this subject. 										
                                    </p>
									<p>
										I also reviewed and commented on some of my peers' posts. I highlighted in these responses my own interest in the conflictions of applying the code (as mentioned 
										above), but also felt that this was not something which was commonly felt amongst others. Possibly this is less surprising to others than it is to me. I did also 
										find further examples of this in the case studies which my peers had reviewed, and I found their applications of the code insightful and informative.  
								
									</p>
									<p>
										I concluded this discussion forum with a summary post, covering what I had learned from the feedback I received and the work of my peers:
										<blockquote>
											by Elliot Bedworth - Sunday, 18 August 2024, 10:27 AM
											<p>
												The case studies presented by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM, N.D.) show relatable, fictional examples of how breaches 
												of the ACM Code of Ethics ("the code") (ACM, 2018) may arise in the real world. 
											</p>
											<p>
											Many common themes across the reviews from myself and my peers indicate the fundamental themes from which the code of ethics is 
											constructed, namely: 
											<ul>	
												<li>Protection of human rights</li>
												<li>Acting for the greater societal good</li>
												<li>Avoiding harm</li>
												<li>Maintaining the good standing of computer science</li>
											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
											Something which I found particularly interesting, whilst reading the case studies and my peers' contributions, was the potential for a 
											scenario to present conflict drawn from the application of the code itself. One example of this, from the case study which I reviewed, 
											was a situation where engineers were justified in speaking publicly to uphold certain sections of the code, but the organisation against 
											whom they were speaking out, was also justified in legally challenging their actions. This is a theme which I also shared in my replies 
											to my peers, as I feel that it presents an interesting avenue for conversation around ethics. 
											</p>
											<p>
											The information presented in this forum has prompted me to consider the true complexity in considering ethics and morality to nuanced 
											situations. Whilst objectivity needs to be sought in order to apply something relatively rigid, such as this code of ethics, it is likely 
											impossible to fit the code to a scenario in a perfect way. Whilst I absolutely agree with the necessity for the code (or other similar 
											documents), it does lead me to reflect on how suitable it truly is, and if there are any alternative, more suitable methods to maintaining 
											morality and ethics in this field.  
											</p>

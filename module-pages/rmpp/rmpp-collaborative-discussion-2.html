								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2</h2>

                                <p> In this, our second collaborative discussion, we were asked to consider the ethical dilemma of Abi, a researcher who is conducting sponsored research 
									on behalf of a cereal company. Abi's research finds unfavourable results, which he is concerned will displease the sponsor, and considers several 
									options to provide a more favourable outcome for the cereal company.

                                        by Elliot Bedworth - Thursday, 26 September 2024, 9:34 PM
										<p>
											The presented scenario provides an example of the complexities of evaluating personal and professional ethics. Often, such an evaluation contains many 
											layers of potential impact which must be considered both individually and holistically to arrive at a conclusion. In addition to this, many  organisations 
											have published ethical guidelines, which provide guidance to individuals related to those organisations. 
										</p>
										<p>
											In this particular scenario, Abi, who is both a researcher and statistical programmer, considers changing the analysis of data found through his research, 
											to present a more favourable result to the research sponsors. It is important here, then, to consider guidance on the ethics of conducting research of any 
											kind, and in particular the presentation of results. 
										</p>
										<p>
											One consideration is the quality of the research itself. As the researcher, Abi has a responsibility to select a suitable approach and method of research 
											before any data are collected (Miller et al., 2012). Aside from this being integral to conducting quality, valid research (QuestionPro, 2021; Belcher 
											et al., 2016), failure to select a suitable method prior to collecting data could lead to legal implications, such as the General Data Protection Regulation 
											2016 (EU, 2016), if data are mishandled. As such, having selected an appropriate method ahead of conducting the research, changing that approach changes the 
											entire structure of the research. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Considering the results of the research which has been conducted, by failing to present the results in their true form may, in turn, cause harm to both 
											consumers and the business who have sponsored this research. Customers may be misled into consuming a product which they believe is healthy, due to the 
											misrepresentation of Abi's research. This may also impact the sponsors of the research, as their business may be perceived as untrustworthy. Here, we can look 
											towards the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct, which positions 'Public Interest' as its first principle (BCS, 2022).
										</p>
										<p>
											Although Abi is concerned about the manufacturer only printing the positive results from the research, this is beyond the scope of Abi's control and so cannot 
											be completely prevented. However, Abi should make a point to summarise both sets of results in the research report. It may also be an option for Abi to make 
											his research public, allowing other researchers to identify the full set of results. Taking this option even further, if Abi believes that the research is 
											clearly being misrepresented and poses potential harm to others, it may be necessary for Abi to take further action, in order to raise awareness of the results 
											in their entirety. This would pose a further ethical dilemma, where Abi likely has to decide to act unethically toward the manufacturer in order to act in the 
											public good, presenting a further example of the nuances of ethical decision making.

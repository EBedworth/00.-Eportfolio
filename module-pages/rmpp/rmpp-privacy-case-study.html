								<h2>Privacy Case Study</h2>

                                <p> In preparation for our Unit 4 seminar, we were tasked with evaluating a fictional case study involving a researcher who required personally
									identifiable information for a study. The scenario is as follows: 
                                </p>
								<p>
									<i>
										Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property 
										tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding 
										names” of some records.
										<br>
										<br>
										Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth 
										asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.
										<br>
										<br>
										Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?
										
									</i>

									<h3><i>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</i></h3>

									<p>
										If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he should hand the request to the person who is responsible. If the responsible 
										persons determines that the names will be released, it may be acceptable for Ricardo to release the names if he is requested to do so. This will 
										also depend on the process in place within the organisation – it may be that Ricardo releases the names to the responsible person, who then 
										performs their own audit of the information before releasing it to Beth. 
										<br>
										<br>
									</p>

									<h3><i>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether 
										to grant access to Beth?</i></h3>

									<p>
										The primary ethical concern with releasing the names to Beth would be focused on privacy and sharing of personal information. When the data held 
										by the local government was collected, the individuals who trusted their data to the organisation did so for a defined purpose. If the data is 
										shared with Beth for research, this use of the data is different from the use which the individuals agreed with previously. As such, the individuals 
										have (likely) not given permission for their data to be shared with Beth. In addition to this, Beth will also now become responsible for protecting 
										this data effectively – something which she may or may not have the capability of doing. Aside from the fact that the individuals have not made an 
										informed decision as to whether Beth is a safe entity to control their data, she would also then be able to see detailed personal information 
										about the individuals.  
										<br>
										<br>
									</p>

									<h3><i>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What 
										are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</i></h3>

									<p>
										As was the case with Ricardo, the primary ethical concerns are around releasing personally identifiable information without the permission of the subject. 
										If Beth were to use that data to then contact the individuals, this would provide another concern as individuals may not wish to be contacted, either 
										at all or using the method which Beth chooses. Even if Beth is contacting the individuals to request permission to use their data, by the time she 
										contacts them she has already accessed personal data which was not initially given to her. 
										<br>
										<br>
									</p>

									<h3><i>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, 
										and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</i></h3>

									<p>
										One option for Beth is to consider an alternative design to her research, which enables her to conduct the research with the data which she has permission 
										to use. A change in design could be to the methodology, using an approach which is suitable to the volume of data she has, or to consider an alternative 
										source of data collection.

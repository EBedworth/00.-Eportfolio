								<h2>Literature Review Outline</h2>

                                <p> Here, we were given the opportunity to provide an outline of our literature review for feedback ahead of submission for Assignment 1.

									<h3 class="major">Submission and Feedback</h3>

									<p>
										I prepared my literature review outline based on the information obtained about writing a well-constructed review in the module reading,
										alongside the literature reviews which I had encountered myself hroughout my course so far. I felt unsure of how I should construct my 
										review, and also that I would be unable to produce an outline without actually conducting the literature review itself, as the content 
										I would find would make up the body of my review. As a result, the review which I submitted felt slightly uncomfortable for me to construct
										and also felt very generic. This made me feel as though the exercise was, to some degree, not worthwhile, although I was also keen to make 
										a submission as I felt so unsure. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Predictably (moreso in hindsight), the feedback was that my literature review was a bit too generic and could use refining. After taking some
										additional time to read about how to construct a good literature review, and looking at my own submission, I experienced something like an epiphany
										about what was required. Initially, I had focused too much on the mass-collection of literature, and had intended to explore what was available to 
										create a literature review which informed me about where the gaps in existing research were. However, after taking more time to understand the 
										value of pointed research questions, and incorporating these into my proposal, I felt more comfortable in constructing something meaningful. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I believe submitting this outline and receiving the feedback was very important for my own development, as I ended with a greater understanding of what was 
										required of me, and what will certainly be required during my project module. My initial submission can be found <a href="Literature review outline.docx">
										here.</a>

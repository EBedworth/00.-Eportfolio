								<h2>Reflective Activity 1 - Ethics in Computing</h2>

                                <p> In this first reflective activity, we were asked to review two articles by Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023) about ethical considerations
									of AI development internationally. We were then asked to consider what we felt the next steps should be to progress the global effort for 
									aligning on ethical development of AI.

									<p>
									The article by Correa et al. (2023) provides a good foundation from which to further explore ethical implications of advancement in artificial 
									intelligence (AI). The approach used in the article is well-designed, such that it achieves the authors’ aim of being ‘reproducible and 
									extendable’. This, then, presents the question of how the work should be extended to provide further insight into this subject. 
									</p>
									<p>
									One particular opportunity, which is highlighted indirectly by the authors, is to reproduce this work with a focus on the areas underrepresented 
									in the existing literature. Looking at the map of represented countries in the article, Africa in particular stands out as having very little 
									representation in the used approach. The authors indicate that, as presented in a paper by Kiemde & Kora (2022), more literature than is 
									represented in this article is available, although was not identified by the methods used. Kiemde & Kora highlight in their paper that Africa has 
									requirements for social improvement which are likely unique to that area. As such, it appears critically important that the opinions and 
									perceptions of the area are considered alongside the already-evaluated regions, as these may provide results which are not highlighted in the 
									existing article. 
									</p>
									<p>
									It is not clear if the approach used in the article can be directly reproduced for underrepresented areas, especially as the initial work did not 
									find the literature which is available from those areas. I believe that a reasonable approach would be to manually focus the research on areas which 
									are highlighted as underrepresented, which can then be evaluated using the same categorisation as was used in the original article. Otherwise, it 
									may be necessary to change the approach used in identifying relevant literature altogether, so that a wider array of content is returned. In this 
									case, the research could be reproduced almost identically, with greater representation across all regions. This may even further the knowledge gained 
									from the well-represented regions of the original study. 
									</p>
									<p>
									In terms of the data identified in the article, one predominant question which comes to my mind is: how can the collective principles be used to 
									create a standard (or standards) for managing ethical AI development? Some of the reviewed literature is made up of legislative documents, and so do 
									set a legal standard, however, these are regional and may make little sense in other regions with different cultural and legal frameworks. By 
									identifying commonality between these regional documents, as well as categorising the type of document from which the principle has come, the data may 
									enable or contribute to the creation of a global standard for AI development. However, it is also crucially important that the previously mentioned 
									further work, in studying the regions which are underrepresented in the article, would be necessary before this work could begin. 
									</p>
									<p>
									The data presented in the article also presents several areas for further research, specifically in the ethical principles which were identified but 
									were not frequently identified in the literature. For example, ‘Children & Adolescent Rights’, which was mentioned only 12 times, may be an area which 
									is overlooked in existing literature. This, therefore, presents an opportunity for new research, which may identify new ethical implications of AI as 
									related to this topic. Some enabling work could take place prior to this, using a similar approach to the article to identify existing literature 
									focused on the specific topic, to further identify the opportunities for research.

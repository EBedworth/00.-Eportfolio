								<h2>Assignment 1</h2>

                                <p>Our first assignment was to design software for three operations which would be incorporated within a self-driving car. We 
                                    had to develop 5 UML diagrams to assist in this design.

									<h3 class="major">Selecting the Operations</h3>

									<p>I began the assignment by selecting three operations which should be available within a self-driving car. I have a good knowledge of cars, 
                                        and have actually been in a self-driving test vehicle during my time in the automotive industry. I also felt it necessary to consider 
                                        how feasible it would be for me to implement some example of theses operations myself. I did feel as though this was maybe not something 
                                        which I should be considering in the context of the assignment, however, I would also have to develop the software for week 11 and so I think 
                                        it would be short-sighted to select a feature which would involve weeks of development. 
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <p>
                                        The operations which I decided on were navigation, adaptive cruise control and lane guidance. I felt that these were all necessary for the 
                                        actual operation of self-driving. I was reluctant to pick an operation like air conditioning or radio, which were not really essential for a 
                                        self-driving car (although I'm sure this would have been fine). Of these three, I had some concern around navigation, as I am aware that solving
                                        the fastest route between two points through a selection of connected points is a common algorithmic challenge. It isn't that I wouldn't like to 
                                        work on this, but returning to the issue of feasibility, I wanted to ensure I focused on using skills developed in this module.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 class="major">UML Diagrams</h3>

                                    <p>      
                                        The first UML diagram required was a use case diagram. I developed the following for my proposed software:
                                    </p>

                                    <img src="img/System Use Case Diagram.jpg">
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        <br>
                                        From this point in the assignment onwards, I think I misinterpreted the brief. For each of my three operations, I developed 4 individual 
                                        diagrams, for a total of 12 additional diagrams. I believe the expectation of the brief was to create 4 additional diagrams, which contained
                                        all of the operations together. I should have clarified this with my tutor before completing this work, and I am slightly annoyed at myself 
                                        for not doing so. I have to put this down to leaving myself too little time to complete the assignment. In terms of the brief itself, I am 
                                        not sure how I could design one class diagram for three operations which are not interacting with each other. I believe this would always
                                        be modelled as three, separate diagrams. Perhaps the solution to this would have been to design them all interacting with the GUI, and then 
                                        show each operation as a branch associated with the GUI. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I also had some problems with the class diagram, due to my own knowledge. I found that I was not as comfortable with them as I had initially 
                                        thought, prior to starting the assignment. I feel as though I became less clear of how my design should be as I progressed through the class
                                        diagram and this led to me trying to reduce complexity (necessary complexity) from the diagrams. Taking a look at the class diagram for the 
                                        navigation system:
                                    </p>

                                    <img src="img/Navigation system class diagram.jpg">

                                    <p>
                                        <br>
                                        I am not sure about the function of GPS or City in this diagram. I also am not certain about the two associations from GPS, one for inheritance
                                        from Location. I did a significant amount of rereading, as well as new reading, during the design of these diagrams and I think that given 
                                        my time pressure, this did not end up helping me. 
                                    </p>                                    
									
                                    <h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I found this assignment very difficult, more so than I had expected. I did put in a lot of work to this design and spent a lot of time 
                                        reading about UML diagrams, looking specifically at examples for vehicles and navigation systems. I am concerned about some key points looking 
                                        ahead to my next assignment. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Firstly, I am not sure still how navigation will work exactly. I know the navigation system will be the most complex of the three systems, and 
                                        I have an outline I think for how these objects will interact. I will have to create something to run as an external GPS system, but I am not 
                                        sure how to have this running constantly (or when the car is supposed to be moving) in parallel with my actual software. I am aware of threading 
                                        and parallel programming, but I do not think either will be implemented easily (and probably should not be for this assignment). 
                                    </p>                 
                                    <p>
                                        I also am concerned about how my misunderstanding the brief will impact my next assignment. I feel that I will definitely need to deviate from 
                                        my design in some respects to create a logical program. But, I am not sure how far I will have to deviate and if this will negatively impact 
                                        my grading of Assignment 2. 
                                    </p>                   
                                    <p>
                                        Overall, I struggled with this assignment, but I am happy that I completed the work in time and produced a lot of UML diagrams. Even if this 
                                        was not the correct approach for this assignment, I do feel as though creating so many diagrams was a useful exercise for my own development 
                                        and made me think about design and the future implications decisions at this stage will have. 
                                    </p>

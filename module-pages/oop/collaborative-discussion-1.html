                                        <br>
                                        by Elliot Bedworth - Tuesday, 15 August 2023, 9:14 AM
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        From Table 1 in the article by Padhy et al. (2018), my prioritisation of the factors is as follows:
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        1. Requirement analysis (RA)
                                        <br>
                                        I have prioritised requirement analysis due to the importance of collecting and documenting the requirements for a project in advance of 
                                        work taking place. A reusable and therefore consistent approach in requirements analysis will reduce hours spent in back-and-forth 
                                        communication and also reduce wasted work resource when working to poorly defined requirements.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        2. Test cases / test design (TCTD)
                                        <br>
                                        The testing process for any system is of clear importance. Whilst tests need to differ for any given system by design, a reusable 
                                        framework for expectations and rigorousness of testing can improve quality and reduce major issues in software releases. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        3. Knowledge requirement (KR)
                                        <br>
                                        The reusability of knowledge generated throughout development allows specialists to emerge for a given system. The reusability of 
                                        knowledge is important as it provides a foundation from which to improve and means that development does not have to begin from the same 
                                        starting point for each system. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        4. Service contracts (SC)
                                        <br>
                                        Reusability of the interface between developers and users provides value for both parties. The users could be more willing and able to 
                                        provide valuable feedback through an interface with which they are familiar. The developers can understand the limitations of an 
                                        interface, to better interpret feedback from users. This feedback loop improves future development and also allows easier identification 
                                        of flaws in existing systems. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        5. Architecture driven approach (ADP)
                                        <br>
                                        Reusability in the structure of the entire project allows developers to become familiar with a system, or the parts which they work in, 
                                        and so develop greater understanding of how the system functions. This can create more efficient developers, who have to spend less time 
                                        working out where something exists within a body of code, and can also enable greater mobility within a team due to developers having an 
                                        implicit understanding of the project architecture. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        6. Design patterns (DP)
                                        <br>
                                        As with ADP, reusing design patterns allows developers to build familiarity with the systems they are building. This can allow for more 
                                        reliable software and higher efficiency from developers. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        7. Documentation in project (DIP)
                                        <br>
                                        Documentation within a project is important because it provides relevant knowledge directly to developers. By ensuring documentation is 
                                        reusable between projects, less time needs to be spent creating documentation for each future development. It is also possible to develop 
                                        standards for documentation, so that less interpretation is required from developers reading documentation provided from a previous project. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        8. Models in the project (MP)
                                        <br>
                                        Reliable models are directly responsible for providing reliable data and so are essential for providing valuable software. Model 
                                        reusability means that tried and tested models, which are known to be reliable, can be used to build future systems without spending 
                                        additional time in development and testing.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        9. An algorithm used in the project (AP)
                                        <br>
                                        As with models, reliable algorithms provide reliable data which is necessary in developing good software. Algorithms which can be reused 
                                        reduce the time required in development and testing. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        10. Used in the data project (UD)
                                        <br>
                                        Reusable data can be very valuable where it is possible to use it, as it reduces the lengthy process of collecting data for each project. 
                                        However, data can frequently change for many applications, so it is also important that reusable data is still relevant. Where data is 
                                        reusable, time can also be saved on development and testing, as developers already understand how to work with a dataset and the results 
                                        which should be produced through testing. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        11. Modules in the program (MIP)
                                        <br>
                                        Modules in the program save time in development as well as improving reliability through the use of existing software which has already 
                                        been tested. Good modules also require several of the factors listed above in order to be useful, such as good documentation and efficient 
                                        testing. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The prioritisation I have provided puts value in the external elements of a project above the value of reusable elements within the software. From my personal experience, I have found that errors made in stages such as requirements analysis, testing and documentation provide far more frequent and serious issues than those created in development.

                                    <h3 class="major">Feedback and Other Posts</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I received feedback for my post, where the responder felt that modules should be placed higher on the list. On reflection, I think that is 
                                        a fair consideration, given that reusable modules can provide immediate reusability, given the right application. However, I also believe
                                        that this reusability is design-dependent, and as such, this relies on other elements in the list (those which I have placed near the top)
                                        to be achievable.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I felt as though this was a common theme amongst my peers, and that value was often placed in the actual elements of implemented software 
                                        over some of the earlier or less-direct elements of the design process. As such, I reviewed my own prioritisation again and identified that 
                                        I had perhaps focused (incorrectly) on what I considered as valuable overall, within the scope of a project, rather than valuable specifically 
                                        to reusability of software. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I summarised these considerations within a final post:

                                        by Elliot Bedworth - Monday, 28 August 2023, 8:09 PM
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Through reading feedback provided to me, alongside the prioritisation of my peers, it is clear that there is no clearly objective way to 
                                        prioritise these elements of reusability. It is possible that personal experience has a significant impact on the prioritisation, 
                                        specifically when related to past projects which people have been involved with. I believe more generally that different job roles may 
                                        prioritise these differently too, as perspectives can change when viewing these elements from different times within the project life 
                                        cycle.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        For my own prioritisation, I have placed more value in the elements of the project not directly involved in the production of software, 
                                        something which is different to some of my peers. On reflection, when considering their position and feedback to me, I may have 
                                        undervalued these elements, as reusable software components (when well defined and tested) remain reusable throughout many projects when 
                                        they are applied to their defined task. Conversely, knowledge and the development of documentation becomes much more changeable by nature 
                                        of being related to a different system. Whilst I still consider requirements analysis to be very important, I may have prioritised some 
                                        of these elements based on my perception of overall value, as opposed to the value in terms of reusability.

								<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

                                <p>Our second assignment was to implement the code which we designed in Assignment 1. We also had to include automated tests that we had run to 
                                    observe the correct execution of our code.

									<p>
                                        I used my UML diagrams from Assignment 1 to start writing the code for the classes which I had planned. As I knew it would be the most complex
                                        and take the longest, I began with the navigation system. I had decided already to create individual files for my project based on each 
                                        operation. I felt that this was a logical grouping and was preferable to creating a file for every class I created. The trade-off was 
                                        more files for easier maintenance, but I felt that having a large number of files would lead to naming issues and long, unwieldy import 
                                        statements. 
                                    </p>                                        
                                    <p>
                                        The overall class design was straight-forward, using the UML diagrams. I referenced Python's PEP 257 for style too, and ensured I had detailed
                                        docstrings for every class. This turned out to be useful later when writing driver code in main.py, as the docstring allowed me to hover
                                        over my new class methods and read what arguments were expected in which order. I also included some data in the navigation file to assist 
                                        with simulation. CITIES is a dictionary of city names mapped to location objects (the GPS coordinates of the city in real life). In design, 
                                        I had planned for a City object which would inherit from Location, however, I felt that this was unnecessary when a dictionary would 
                                        perform the same function as I was hoping to achieve. I also created a DIRECTION_LIST, which contained strings of instructions that you might
                                        see on a navigation system. This list is to simulate a system generating a route to a destination, as this was not something that I would 
                                        realistically be able to program. I used Python's random module here to grab a random selection of instructions for use in the Direction 
                                        objects. I also used this approach in the ACC module, for simulating sensor readings corresponding to the distance of an approaching object.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In main.py, I created some driver code so that any of the three systems could be launched from the terminal. I requested user input to 
                                        navigate through the menu which allowed each system to launch. I also created some simulated output from each system, which would, in 
                                        reality, be output data to some system which had called an object method. Whilst this was useful for my own testing and to show how 
                                        each system would operate, I think that I may have deviated too far from how the system would operate in reality. The GPS object in 
                                        particular became slightly long winded, in order to continuously generate new positional coordinates which were also moving in the correct
                                        direction along a route. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 class="major"><br>Testing</h3>

                                    <p>      
                                        I used unittest for testing my program. I created individual files again for each function and included tests for any class methods which
                                        had any real potential to fail (anything other than setters and getters). I found unittest to be reasonably simple to implement once I had 
                                        written my first test, although the process did also feel very long winded. I expect there is significant functionality which I am not yet
                                        aware of, because the effort spent writing the tests did not feel particularly worthwhile. It would have been quicker and easier to simply
                                        test the functions and methods which I tested in unittest manually, with the inputs I had configured in my test classes. However, I do know 
                                        that there are other methods available for testing more complex code. 
                                    </p>
									
                                    <h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I spent a lot of time on this assignment, ensuring that it was styled well and testing various elements of functionality. In the end, I was
                                        happy with the work that I produced. I do think that I spent too long in creating code which simulated something human-readable to print
                                        to the command line, where I should have focused on how those objects would function in real life. This is especially true in the case of 
                                        the GPS object, which deviated significantly from how I would expect a GPS to function. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This assignment was also challenging, although in a different way to Assignment 1. I felt as though we had been thrown in at the deep end
                                        slightly for this assignment, as I have not got experience in writing complete programs, let alone object-oriented programs, and I felt as 
                                        though the application of a self-driving car was quite complex. Throughout the development, I wanted to have a parallel program running to 
                                        simulate data for my objects such as the ACC Sensor objects and the GPS. However, that is very out of scope of this module, and beyond my 
                                        current skillset, and I found it frustrating that I couldn't simulate the car driving when all of my software was developed with driving 
                                        in mind. 
                                    </p>                 
                                    <p>
                                        Overall, I am happy with the work that I produced and I definitely feel as though the assignment helped me develop my software skills and 
                                        cemented some of the concepts of object-oriented program in my mind. I look forward to feeling more confident about building object-oriented
                                        programs in the future. 
                                    </p>

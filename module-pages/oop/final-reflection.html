									<h3 class="major">Contents, Structure & Learning</h3>

									<p>I was excited to start this module, after reading the description in the course brochure. I was particularly keen to understand how to use 
                                        and apply UML, having seen examples of class diagrams online in tutorial videos, as I felt that planning and designing a large software 
                                        project were very important skills which would enable me to design larger-scale projects of my own. I was also interested in 
                                        object-oriented programming, something which I had slightly more knowledge of but again, a very important, well-discussed development tool
                                        which was not yet part of my skillset. 
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <p>
                                        The Object-Oriented Programming module began with some fundamental introductions to OOP, where we explored class attributes (protected and 
                                        private) and methods. Before expanding too deeply on the full functionality of these concepts, UML was introduced, along with ‘The Unified 
                                        Modelling Language Reference Manual, Second Edition’. We studied several different UML views and developed some of our own diagrams along 
                                        the way. I felt that this move to UML after only learning the fundamentals of OOP was well positioned, as the OOP concepts helped with 
                                        studying certain elements of UML, particularly the class diagram, which is built around the software objects within a program.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>      
                                        Following this, we returned to classes and explored more practical and in-depth concepts, such as inheritance and encapsulation. At this 
                                        time, our first assignment was also due, where we were tasked with designing our own software application, using UML, to provide some 
                                        functionality as part of a self-driving car. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I found Assignment 1 difficult, which I attribute mostly to factors outside of the course. My work schedule has been very demanding for the 
                                        duration, meaning I have been abroad working from various hotel rooms for most of this module. This was a situation that I knew I would 
                                        find myself in when I began the course and I dealt with some things well, such as being aware of what was due by when, well in advance, and 
                                        ensuring I had study materials available offline. However, I also struggled for time, particularly with Assignment 1. In the end, I was 
                                        disappointed with the work that I had produced and felt at times as though I had not understood either the brief, or the elements of UML 
                                        which I was trying to use. The best solution would have been for me to reach out to my tutor to clarify the brief, however, given the time 
                                        pressure, I did not do this, which was a failing on my part. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After Assignment 1, the course shifted focus again to data structures and testing. This was another subject which I was looking forward to 
                                        studying, understanding the value of testing from my own career in engineering. We covered automated testing using both unittest and 
                                        pytest, which I later incorporated into the development of my self-driving car software. We learned about cyclomatic complexity and 
                                        attempts to measure the complexity of object-oriented code. For data structures, we explored the built-in types and considered how they too 
                                        were objects, with well-designed wrappers. Another useful tool was introduced in comprehensions, and a maybe less useful one in coroutines. 
                                        I felt that this whole section of the course provided real value in terms of different tools within Python, particularly through Python 
                                        modules and coding techniques, which have already made me better at coding than I was before the module.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Assignment 2 was due in week 11. The assignment was to implement the software which we had designed in Assignment 1. I felt more 
                                        comfortable programming than I did creating UML diagrams, however, because of my lack of confidence in what I had done during design 
                                        (reinforced by some of the valid feedback I received for my assignment), I knew that I needed to change some of the elements which I had 
                                        initially planned. I wrote a substantial amount of code for my assignment and tried to ensure I followed relevant PEPs for style and 
                                        documentation. I also think that I went too far in making my code ‘usable’ for marking purposes. I created a lot of functionality to 
                                        simulate the code working, mostly by print data which would normally be returned to some other calling object. On reflection, I think I 
                                        should have implemented the software exactly how it would be implemented when part of a larger system, as the marker clearly would 
                                        understand the functionality without my messages being printed to the terminal. This cost me significant time (which I was short of anyway) 
                                        and in some places made me fundamentally change how some elements should have worked. When I submitted the assignment though, I was happy 
                                        that my software was well presented, logically written and ‘complete’ (in terms of functionality). 
                                    </p>                                    
									
                                    <h3 class="major">My Experience</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I greatly enjoyed this module and felt that the content and assessment components led to tangible improvements in my overall software 
                                        development abilities. At the same time, I found this module significantly more challenging than Launching into Computer Science. I believe 
                                        this is largely down to my study being disjointed because of my demanding work schedule. However, I need to address this problem in future 
                                        modules by being more specific with planning what I am going to complete in each available study window for each week. I can achieve this 
                                        by creating a study plan in a spreadsheet, broken down into 1-hour blocks. Each week, I can identify the realistic hours that I can study, 
                                        and I can then allocate some of the weeks work into each of these blocks. This will allow me to maintain continuous study throughout the 
                                        week (as is normal when I am at home) as opposed to catching up on missed material when I have larger study windows available. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Something which I feel good about at the end of this module is my ability to write good code efficiently. I am still far from a Python 
                                        developer (obviously), however, I found myself being able to plan and write code very quickly and identify good design patterns for solving 
                                        a particular problem. I think overall, this module has improved my self-confidence in developing software and I feel that my skillset has 
                                        grown substantially. Completing this module has given me more enthusiasm going forward into my next modules, where I hope to be build to 
                                        further build on the solid foundations that have been built here. 
                                    </p>

									<h3 class="major">The Power of ePortfolio Development</h3>

									<p><a href="https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/H_Nadir_Power_2021.pdf" target="_blank">The article</a> describes a study into the efficacy of 
                                        ePortfolios in providing a better learning experience for those in adult education. The authors explain a lack of current existing research 
                                        and set out to understand the value of an ePortfolio from the perspective of a group of students undertaking graduate-level education. 
                                        <br>
										<br>
                                        The researches reviewed anonymous, reflective reports written by the students and identified key statements from within these to code the data 
                                        against key themes related to the students' opinion of the value of the ePortfolio. These coded data were shared within the research team for 
                                        explanation and review. From this, three key themes were identified which were shared amongst the students: 

                                        <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Students became more reflective learners who frequently experienced deeper transformative learning.</li>
                                                <li>Students were surprised by greater self-discovery and significant personal growth.</li>
                                                <li>Students found new strengths.</li>
                                            </ol>

                                        I felt the article was a good piece of initial research into the benefits of ePortfolio use in graduate-level education. The researchers
                                        explain in good detail their methods for data collection and data evaluation and have taken measures to ensure the data is as reliable as 
                                        possible with these chosen methods. Something which the article does not cover, or have any examples of, is any negative feedback from the
                                        students regarding their experience. It is entirely possible that no negative experience was reported by the students. If this is the case, 
                                        then I feel that more should have been done to prompt students for such a reflection, in order to ensure that balanced feedback was received. 
                                        It may also be necessary to review the methods in which the data is collected, as the initial student reports were written at the end of 
                                        their course. This may have led to some unconscious bias around not wanting to write comments perceived as negative by the institution with
                                        which they have just completed their studies, or by the faculty who they have built relationships with. 
										<br>
										<br>
										These suggestions do not detract from my opinion of the research, which I found to be interesting and valuable. I have also experienced 
                                        personally the lack of other research into this topic as, during a previous module, we were asked to research and discuss the benefits of 
                                        ePortfolio use within post-graduate education. I experienced great difficulty finding relevant research which addressed the question of value
                                        directly, despite finding many examples of that question being asked. Reviewing this article, I can see the value this would have added to 
                                        my own research at that time. I am overall impressed with the way in which the data has been grouped and presented, given the subjective nature
                                        of the answers.  
                                    </p>

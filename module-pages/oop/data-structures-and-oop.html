                                    <h3 class="major">Python Data Types and OOP</h3>

									<p>
                                        The Python programming language provides some special built-in data types beyond the more 'standard' types which we frequently encounter 
                                        in other languages. Four of these structures in particular can be considered as functionally distinct from each other:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>List</li>
                                            <li>Tuple</li>
                                            <li>Dictionary</li>
                                            <li>Set</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        The inclusion of such data types can appear, at least instinctively, to be a reason for object-oriented programming to be <i>less</i> 
                                        necessary, due to the functionality which is achievable through their inclusion. However, these data structures and others, both built in 
                                        and within modules, actually support the development of object-oriented software. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first way in which these data structures support object-oriented programming is by providing the ability to use objects within the 
                                        context of each of the structures. To provide an example of this point, lists, sets, tuples and dictionaries (values, not keys) can all 
                                        be class objects. In some instances, some additional configuration of the classes is required (e.g. for sets), however, creating a list 
                                        of class objects can be done straight out of the box. This functionality only extends the possibility of what can be done with class 
                                        objects, and supports object-oriented programming. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to this, the built-in data types listed above operate in a very object-oriented way themselves. Where we create classes,  
                                        instantiate objects from those classes and then manipulate data by using methods and attributes of the class in the context of our object, 
                                        the Python data structures allow us to use methods and access attributes in the same way. If we consider the dictionary method pop(), the 
                                        syntax for using the method would be <code>myDictionary.pop(some_key)</code>. We can see the similarity here to our own object oriented 
                                        syntax, where we follow the structure <code>myObject.method(data)</code>. The similarties here are such that the lines begin to blur 
                                        between built-in data structures and our own user-defined classes, further supporting use of an object-oriented approach.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, we should consider the combination of the above and the powerful functionality which is possible when using user-defined classes
                                        with built-in data types. Comprehensions allow very succinct program development, maintaining human readability and flexibility whilst 
                                        also manipulating data effectively. Through comprehensions, we can very efficiently combine built-in data structures with our user-defined 
                                        classes to develop software which is again flexible and effective. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although at first glance, it may appear that Python data structures reduce the need for developers to use an object-oriented approach, when 
                                        we reflect on how the data structures interact with user-defined classes, we see that the opposite is true. Not only do these data structures
                                        work with other objects, they are actually types of object themselves. Through the combination of using these data types with our own user-defined
                                        objects, our options for development are greatly increased. 
                                    </p>

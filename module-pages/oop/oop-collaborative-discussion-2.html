								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2</h2>

                                <p> Our second collaborative discussion, started in Unit 8, involved reviewing the article: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Claudio-Savaglio/publication/304292403_Towards_a_Development_Methodology_for_Smart_Object-Oriented_IoT_Systems_A_Metamodel_Approach/links/59dde1baa6fdcc276fbdaa35/Towards-a-Development-Methodology-for-Smart-Object-Oriented-IoT-Systems-A-Metamodel-Approach.pdf">
                                    <i>'Towards a Development Methodology for Smart Object-Oriented IoT Systems: a Metamodel Approach'</i></a> and considering the strengths and weaknesses of 
                                    designing a metamodel to support obect-oriented design of the Internet of Things. In addition to this, we were asked to design our own smart model, as seen in 
                                    Figure 6 of the article.

                                        by Elliot Bedworth - Monday, 2 October 2023, 10:02 PM
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The article proposes an interesting approach to designing Smart Objects (SOs), which themselves are an important object oriented design 
                                        element for IoT development. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This was my first exposure to the metamodel approach and I feel that the article does well in showing its strengths. Through modelling 
                                        the SOs at different levels of abstraction, through the varying stages of development, a broad standardisation is developed which allows 
                                        for high levels of consistency across development teams and applications. This in itself also contributes to building a clear design 
                                        roadmap, which will enable clearer setting of project milestones against the requirements for each model. In addition to this, the 
                                        approach of modelling the models at increasing levels of granularity introduces a higher-level view of each stage of development. I 
                                        believe this will benefit teams by both prompting more forethought in the early stages of design, and by enabling more efficient changes 
                                        at a later development stage (if/when required) by providing such a view. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Considering the approach further, I do have reservations about the level of inflexibility in such an approach. If the metamodel approach 
                                        is to be applied as intended, across many instantiations of the object model being modelled, where do developers turn if their 
                                        requirements do not align with the existing metamodel? I would expect this to require deviation from the metamodel, or creation of an 
                                        entirely new SO which may share much functionality with the slightly different existing model. This of course would create additional 
                                        (re)work, as opposed to improving the design process. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I have attached my own example of how the approach in the article may be applied to the design of a self-driving car.

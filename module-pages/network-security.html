									Network Security was my fifth module for the University of Essex MSc Computer Science course. I started this 6-week module on 11th June 2024.

										<h3 class="major">Module Overview</h3>
										<p>
											This module focused on the impact of cyber security on on network systems and designs. This was delivered through a combination of case studies 
											from real-world events, and introduction of a variety of techniques which can be used to scan, evaluate and often mitigate network vulnerabilities.
											The assessments for this module involved performing vulnerability assessments on a vulnerable website, and suggesting security improvements as a 
											result of the findings. 
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">Collaborative Discussions</h3>
										<p>
											The first collaborative discussion for this module required us to evaluate the security implications of the Digital Economy, reviewing literature 
											on fully-digital enterprises and the challenges faced by traditional, brick-and-mortar enterprises as they attempt to undergo digital revolution. 
											Our second collaborative discussion explored the impact of the Log4j vulnerability (otherwise known as Log4Shell), whereby a vulnerability in the 
											widely-used Java Log4j logging framework was identified. The discussion raised some interesting questions between students about the trade-off 
											between logging tools as useful in the protection of networks, but also exposed to vulnerabilities, particularly through lack of standardisation.   
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">Scanning Activity</h3>
										<p>
											The scanning activity was an exercise whereby I conducted basic scans on the network of the vulnerable website which was used for the module 
											assignments. Only basic tools such as traceroute, dig and nslookup were used to discover any information about the site, such as server location and 
											MX records. Results of these scans contributed to the module assignments by forming part of the vulnerability assessment.

								<h2>Google AI Tools</h2>

                                <p>In Unit 3, students were asked to investigate and review 'AI Tools by Google', an online learning platform for those wanting to develop 
                                    their skills and knowledge in artificial intelligence.

									<h3 class="major">AI Tools by Google</h3>

									<p><a href="https://ai.google/" target="_blank">Google AI</a> hosts a variety of resources for people to learn about AI, with a specific focus
                                        on technical skills for developing AI systems. The site contains some information regarding Google's use of and vision for AI, with examples
                                        of ongoing, real-world applications. 
                                        <br>
										<br>
                                        I found the website to contain a lot of useful content for learning about developing AI and Machine Learning. The resources available are 
										suitable for a variety of technical skills, including several different laguages and frameworks which are suitable for the subject applications. 
										There are also tools to assist in the creation of applications, such as Studio Bot, which is actually an AI generated coding assistant, which can
										in turn help you to code new AI systems. 
										<br>
										<br>
										As I have no experience in developing AI systems, almost all of the information on the site is new to me. I think this can seem daunting, in some 
										respects, as you are presented with a clear view of how much there is for you still to learn. However, it is also good to know that such a wealth 
										of knowledge on a single (broadly speaking) subject is available in one place. Certainly, when I am ready to learn about the technical aspects
										of AI and ML, I will almost certainly use Google AI as a source to learn from. 
                                    </p>

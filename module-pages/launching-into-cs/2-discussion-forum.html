                                <p>This was the first discussion forum task of the module. It involves making a post in Unit 1, then commenting on other students' posts through
                                    units 2 and 3. The brief was as follows:

									<p>
                                        Computer systems in some form are used by billions of people around the world on a daily basis. The scale of this utility places a 
                                        significant burden of responsibility upon both the users and the professionals who develop, maintain and deliver these systems.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The British Computer Society outline four major points in their code of conduct, intended as an outline of ethical and professional 
                                        practice for all computing professionals (BCS, 2022):
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>'Public interest'</li>
                                            <li>'Professional competency and integrity'</li>
                                            <li>'Duty to relevant authority'</li>
                                            <li>'Duty to the profession'</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        These tenets serve the purpose of providing broad guidelines against which IT professionals can make decisions on their own professional 
                                        conduct. The prevalent theme is one of ethical behaviour and awareness of the wider implications of the actions of the individual. Somewhat 
                                        counter-intuitively when considering a technical field, the BCS code of conduct suggests that best practice for IT professionals is focused 
                                        more on behaviour, integrity and respect than on specific technical practices. This approach is shared by similar organisations too. The 
                                        Association for Computing Machinery Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018), whilst more detailed, has the same emphasis on the importance of ethical 
                                        behaviour for computing professionals.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Whilst the purpose of the BCS code of conduct and ACM code of ethics is to enable professionals to make their own ethical decisions, it 
                                        does leave significant room for interpretation and degree of application at an individual level. Also, whilst these documents are indicative 
                                        of the values which professional bodies consider to be of high importance for individuals working in the field, they are not directly 
                                        enforceable for those who are not members of the respective organisation. This emphasises the importance of enacting more focused codes of 
                                        conduct for organisations, which relate to their specific activities, and also the importance of regulation, which protects good, ethical 
                                        practice in law. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Looking at the IT policy enforced by my employer, I can see that the focus shifts considerably towards security, as opposed to ethics. The 
                                        policy covers physical security, such as not leaving equipment unattended or using USB drives, as well as digital security related to downloading 
                                        non-approved software or enforcing the use of multi-factor authentication for all devices. Whilst there is some focus on ethical use of computer 
                                        equipment, it seems to be driven by protecting corporate reputation and intellectual property as opposed to being for the greater good, as seen 
                                        in the codes of conduct from the BCS and ACM. However, the company is also protecting itself from penalties enacted as a result of failing to 
                                        adhere to regulations (such as GDPR) which in turn, protect individuals with whom the company conducts business (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 
                                        the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data 
                                        and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), 2016).
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I have found in the past that corporate IT policy can prove to be cumbersome in practice, as the policies are often strict and prevent 
                                        necessary functionality for people within certain job roles. I believe this is an unfortunate side-effect of trying to apply a single policy to 
                                        every area of the business, which is generally diverse in regards to awareness of threats and computer literacy. This perceived inconvenience can 
                                        and does lead to employees willingly disregarding the policy, which can in turn damage both the company and individuals whose personal data may 
                                        be leaked or stolen without their knowledge. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Initially, I considered that implementing a more versatile and less impactful IT code of conduct, whilst being more laborious for the company, would 
                                        yield an improvement on the problem of employees willingly disregarding the policy. However, a recent investigation on a number of employees at large 
                                        organisations showed that the employees perception of how much or little the policy inconvenienced them did not seem to influence how obedient they 
                                        were of the policy (Kim & Han, 2018). Interestingly, the same investigation found a positive correlation between employee compliance to the IT policy 
                                        and the employee's perception of how ethical the company was. Considering my own evaluation of my employer's policy to be more focused on security 
                                        than ethics, I found it interesting that this investigation brought the focus of conduct, even for corporate policies, back to ethics. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The differences in codes of conduct between organisations that I have considered above seems sensible. Professional bodies will have codes of conduct 
                                        which protect the profession, and companies will have codes of conduct which protect the company. Regulation will drive these policies, as often 
                                        penalties from non-compliance to regulation are what organisations (companies more so) are protecting against. Consistently, ethical behaviour has 
                                        underpinned the content of these codes of conduct, either directly or indirectly. This particularly makes sense for computer science, where many of 
                                        the technologies in use are either transient or very new. Much of the discourse focuses on specific ethical practices such as professionalism, 
                                        continuous learning and honesty, particularly as related to an individual's competency (Stahl, Timmermans & Mittelstadt, 2016). By associating good 
                                        practice so directly with these ethical behaviours, the complexity of maintaining a good code of conduct for computer professionals is considerably 
                                        reduced by eliminating dependency on any specific technology, which can be enforced at an organisational level, and encourages a culture of working 
                                        to values which are beneficial for society as a whole.

								<h2>Creating the E-Portfolio</h2>

                                <p>One the first tasks assigned in Unit 1 of Launching into Computer Science is to create the e-portfolio site. The purpose of the 
                                    e-portfolio is to store and showcase the student's work completed throughout the course. 
                                </p>

                                <p>It is mandated that the e-portfolio will be created on GitHub, using the Pages feature. I have some familiarity with GitHub already, 
                                    but Pages was new to me. I followed the instructions provided in the Virtual Learning Environment to set up my site.

									<h3 class="major">Choosing a Template</h3>

									<p>I spent a long time choosing the base template for my site. In the VLE guide, the site <a href="http://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>
                                        is recommended. They have some really high quality templates available there, and they are all on Creative Commons licensing, meaning they 
                                        can be used for most purposes as long as the original creator is credited. I spent a long time looking through this site and others, 
                                        because I wanted to avoid selecting a template that many other students would also choose. However, after running through many sites
                                        which claimed they had free templates, but eventually asked for payment, I selected a template from HTML5 UP.  
                                    </p>

									<h3 class="major">Modifying the Template</h3>

                                    <p>After choosing a template, I needed to upload the source code to my GitHub account and enable the Pages feature to use the template. 
                                        The guide in the VLE made this process quite easy. Once uploaded, I could navigate to the URL generated in the repository settings 
                                        and see my new site running. I now needed to get to work modifying the content of the site to change it from a template to my e-portfolio. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I maybe hadn't appreciated the scale of this task. The template is, of course, a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and there was <b>a 
                                        lot</b> of content which needed to change. I have had some exposure to HTML and CSS previously through taking introductory web design courses
                                        online, so this was at least slightly familiar. To work on the changes, I decided to use VSCode. I have been using VSCode for last few months,
                                        on various tutorials and courses, so I am familiar with the environment. I also find VSCode to be very versatile and intuitive, and the
                                        extensions for linking directly to GitHub make source control very easy. Saying that, I encountered a problem immediately when trying to 
                                        synchronise with the e-portfolio repository and my local machine. Because I had another GitHub account connected previously, I was unable 
                                        to access the e-portfolio repository to commit changes. I ended up having to go into Credential Manager in Windows, select the 'Windows Credentials'
                                        option, and modify the entry under 'git:https://github.com'. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Once I had the repository open in VSCode, I set about looking through what I had available for me to work from. In the provided template, 
                                        there was a page containing a number of elements, presumably for use within the site. There was also an example page containing a sample
                                        article that might represent a page on the final site. I could understand broadly the HTML layout and the CSS references, although the 
                                        JavaScript was somewhat of a mystery. I looked through that anyway, even though most of the JavaScript files had minified, meaning it was
                                        very unpleasant to look at. After understanding what I could about the content and file structure already in place, I decided to start 
                                        simple and create the pages that I would need for my e-portfolio as blank .html files in the root of the file structure. I then started
                                        with the index page, modifying the menu entries to link to my pages. I also (embarrasingly) spent around an hour trying to change the small 
                                        icon above the title on the index page from a diamond into a 'code' icon (&lt;/>). The icons had been included from a web font package from 
                                        <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">fontawesome.com</a>, which is where I had managed to find the code icon. However, 
                                        when trying to change the reference from the diamond to the code icon, the circle would appear empty. In the end, it turned out that the
                                        icons were grouped into different .svg files, and I needed to use an icon that was within the same .svg as the diamond. This can be seen
                                        inside the assets/webfonts folder, where there are three .svg files each containing a selection of icons. I assume there are differences 
                                        in size, layout or structure which prevent some icons from fitting in the space I was trying to fill. In the end, I selected the 
                                        paper-with-code-icon that you can see on the home page.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Once I was happy with the index page, I used the code here as a template for the About Me page. This page took a long time to complete, 
                                        because of the volume of content, but as this only needs to be completed once, it seemed worthwhile doing it properly now. After
                                        finishing the text, I decided that I wanted to have the background change for different sections, as it looked a bit too solid 
                                        compared to the theme of the site. The structure in the template creates new wrappers for certain sections, like the header and footer, 
                                        but not for the body, so I had to experiment a little with the CSS references to find one that looked correct. The result can be seen
                                        at the 'Studying and Future Aspirations' section of the About Me page.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I wanted to make the My Work page visually different from the About Me page, as I was conscious of the site looking a bit boring. I 
                                        decided to use an image grid to link to individual modules: 
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/module-img/launching-into-cs/image-grid.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>

                                    <p>
                                        I may try to find more suitable images in the future. These have been created by me overlaying some text over the sample pictures 
                                        which came with the template. For now, I think this looks better than just another list (there are some more lists to come).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I had already thought about and decided that the pages which linked to articles (such as examples of work or journal entries) should 
                                        show the available items in a list. I made this decision because although lists are rarely visually pleasing, I intended to have 
                                        a large amount of this kind of content on the site, and I wanted to make it easy to navigate to the item which the user wanted to look 
                                        at. I think if I had used some kind of image grid for this, it would make that navigation a bit laborious. Having the items in a list
                                        would also make it easier for me to add new items, as I can simply add a new line to the list rather than having to find an image, change
                                        the size of the image grid and so on. There were also two tables included in the elements page of the template, which presented a list 
                                        in an easy to view and use format. I decided to use one of these for the module pages and the journal main page. I also created folders 
                                        to store these pages in, rather than storing them at the root of the file structure. I made this decision because again, there will end up 
                                        being a large number of these pages, so it makes sense to have them organised to some degree. The trade-off here is that I had to change
                                        the filepath for any links from these pages, as they no longer reside in the same folder as the other pages. This, however, is also something
                                        that only really needed to be done once, so long as I use the code from these pages as a template for future pages in the same folder. 
                                        Finally, I decided to make the links to the artefacts and journal pages open in a new tab, rather than the same window, which felt 
                                        better to me when navigating around. I went back and changed the links in the footer to my LinkedIn page to do this too.                              
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                    <h3 class="major">#TODO</h3>

                                    <p>I am happy at this stage, in week 1, with how my e-portfolio looks. However, whilst working on it, I considered some further things I 
                                        would like to achieve during my progression through the course.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Not use a template</h4>

                                    <p>Whilst the templates on HTML5 UP are really high quality, and I am happy with how this one looks, I would like to build my own site 
                                        without using a template from somebody else. This will require a lot of work, so I expect it to be a ongoing task that I can work on 
                                        when I get the opportunity. It would be a good personal achievement to have built something completely myself though, as opposed 
                                        to using the work of somebody else. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Dynamic Pages</h4>

                                    <p>There are going to end up being a significant amount of pages for journal entries and artefacts. In the current site, each 
                                        one of these pages will need to be a new .html file which is configured manually with links and references. I feel as though there 
                                        probably is already some method of dynamising these pages, by having a single template page and then populating the template fields
                                        from a database, based on which link is clicked. I'm certain many web pages already work like this, but I haven't researched this 
                                        myself yet. I think this would be worthwhile for making a more modular site. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Add more images</h4>

                                    <p>I'm acutely aware that the site is slightly boring, and made up almost entirely of text. I will endeavour to add more images throughout 
                                        as I'm adding content. 
                                    </p>

								<h2>Data Structures</h2>

                                <p>In Unit 3, we were asked to read an article by Dicheva & Hodge (2018) detailing a game they had developed to help students of Computer Science to 
									understand the concept of stacks and queues. We were asked to consider a system which we use frequently, and what data structures might be in use
									in the backend of that system.

									<h3 class="major">Online Banking</h3>
									<p>
										The online system that I have chosen to reflect on is an online banking app for a mobile phone. Due to there being a number of banking options, there
										are (almost) an equivalent amount of banking apps available. And whilst these apps do have different features, the key features are generally common across
										them all.
									</p>
									<p>
										In terms of generic features (which I will focus on for this refelection, as opposed to more app-specific features), the following things will usually be 
										present in mobile banking app:
										<ul>
											<li>Customer details</li>
											<li>List of accounts</li>
											<li>Account details (number, balance, available)</li>
											<li>Correspondence</li>
											<li>Card services (cancel, order new card)</li>
										</ul>
										I would expect that the things we might call 'objects' from this list would each be a data structure, things like 'Customer', 'Account', 'Card'. It's possible 
										that the actual structures are more specific than this - for example, maybe there are separate structures for 'Savings Account' and 'Current Account'. It 
										could also be the case that a data structure for 'Account' has an element which determines the type of account. So this structure might contain a string 'accType'
										which specifies the type of account in use. In reality, the data structures involved will be far more diverse and specific than the simple example I have provided
										here (Kittlaus & Krahl, 1998). 
									</p>
									<p>
										In reality, as most of the banking data will be held across a number of databases, the data structures in use will likely be structured as related to the schema
										of the relevant tables included in the database. This likely also includes some data structures which are used specifically to relate different data together (in 
										the <i>relational</i> databases). When we think about the algorithms which banking systems use to calculate the rates at which they can offer loans to their customers,
										we can see that very complex structures must be required to collate a large collection of data about an individual, before processing it through whichever system 
										generates the final decision.

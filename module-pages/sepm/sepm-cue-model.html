								<h2>Components of User Experience Model</h2>

                                <p>In Unit 7, we were asked to answer the following question:
                                </p>
								<p>
									<i>'As a Project Manager, what might be your response to manage the emotional reactions of a customer?'</i>

									<p>
										There is not only one correct answer to the question of how to manage emotional customer reactions, it will always be 
										dependent on context and character, as well as myriad other factors which make up the complexity of human relationships. 
										To consider some possible appraches, we can talk more broadly about how the project manager might decide on the correct 
										approach to take, given a certain situation. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I believe the first act of the Project Manager should always be to evaluate the source of the emotion, before taking any
										action. Although some emotions are an acceptable part of work (Lindgren et al, 2014), often they can manifest in a way 
										which is unacceptable and not productive to the project delivery. The Project Manager must first use their emotional 
										intelligence to empathise with the customer, understand the source of the emotion, and then decide if it is something 
										which can or should be tackled. The requirement for the Project Manager to do this successfully is one of the reasons 
										that emotional intelligence has become widely regarded as a mandatory skill for a successful Project Manager to have 
										(Livesey, 2017).
									</p>
									<p>
										Assuming the emotion is a response to what might be considered 'reasonable' stimulus, the Project Manager should take action 
										to create a plan to tackle the issue. It would be prudent at this stage to inform the customer of the intention to create an 
										action plan. However, it may also be wise to keep details reserved until all of the options are understood and certain, 
										otherwise the customer may become more emotional. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Once the best plan is known, it should be relayed to the customer. This also requires some emotional intelligence, as the best 
										plan may still be a trigger to the customer. However, at the stage the plan should be known as the best one, and so should 
										definitely be shared. Purposefully holding information back may likely lead to a worsened relationship in the future. It is 
										another immportant skill for Project Managers (in fact all managers) to be able to effectively deliver bad news (Bies, 2013).
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, the Project Manager must manage the plan to ensure delivery is executed as agreed with the customer. Although this can 
										be, to some extent, out of their control, they must be focused on delivery and also communicative with the customer, providing 
										regular updates and mitigations to challenges as they come up. This stage might be considered the more 'traditional' idea of 
										what a Project Manager does, and should not be forgotten about when compared to newer definitions of a Project Manager.

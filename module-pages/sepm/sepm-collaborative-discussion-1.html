									An analysis of their relationships.' by Lehtinen et al. (2014) and answer the following questions:
									<ol>
										<li>What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?</li>
										<li>Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).</li>
									</ol>

										<br>
										<br>
										The study by Lehtinen et. al (2014) explores the subject of project failures through case studies of real-world failures, experienced by 
										four different companies. Throughout the study, attempts are made to identify the cause of each project failure by applying root-cause 
										analysis techniques to map the path of failure through each contributing factor which led to that occurrence. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Whilst the study concludes that project failures are multi-faceted, based on perspective and less often attributable to a single mode of 
										failure, my own experience highlights the following as the most common cause of failure:
										<br>
										<br>
										<ul>
											<li>Lack of communication</li>
											<li>Poorly defined requirements</li>
											<li>Unrealistic estimations of cost/time</li>
										</ul>
										Whilst my prioritisation is biased, based on my own position within the project, these factors can be found within the study as contributing 
										factors to failure. Furthermore, a journal article by Cerpa & Verner (2009), lists 'delivery date impacted the development process' and 
										'project under-estimated' as the two most-frequent factors of failure on software projects, suggesting that my own experience has at the 
										least been shared by others working on software projects. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Other examples of real-world failures caused by these factors can be found. One such example is Knight Capital, who in 2012 delivered 
										incomplete software in a project for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to unrealistic estimation of development 
										time (Saltapidas & Maghsood, 2018). Another example, this time showing clear issues related to lack of communication, is the Airbus A380 
										Program. The issues which arose here related to a large, diverse workforce operating in silos, without managed communication, resulting in 
										major failures related to project delivery (Dörfler & Baumann, 2014).

                                        Following my initial post, I received feedback from several of my peers on my views regarding project failures. The feedback I received was generally 
										in agreement with my own views, especially regarding poorly-defined requirements being a fundamental cause of failure. One point which was highlighted 
										as a possible improvement was to relate the causes of failure to each other, to explain how these interactions could contribute more than each individual 
										factor.
                                    </p>
									<p>
										I also reviewed and commented on some of my peers' contributions. One of the posts had expanded beyond the original question to include some approaches 
										to avoiding failure, which provided additional relevant context and allowed for greater understanding of the domain. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I concluded this discussion forum with a summary post, covering what I had learned from the feedback I received and the work of my peers:
										<blockquote>
											by Elliot Bedworth - Monday, 1 April 2024, 11:01 AM
											<br>
											<br>
											In my initial forum post, based on the study by Lehtinen et. al (2014), I provided my opinion of three high-frequency causes of project failure. 
											Through review of my peers' contributions and the feedback provided to me, I still believe my opinion to be one that is commonly-held. However, it is 
											also more clear to me that project failure can rarely be attributed to a single cause and in fact, attempting to do so is likely not a productive 
											approach to avoiding future failures. 
											<br>
											<br>
											From review of the course text by Stellman & Greene (2005), it is possible to identify, more broadly, issues or cultural practices which may be more 
											inclined to lead to failure. Where the text details some of the important factors for successful project management - such as 'Tell Everyone the Truth 
											All the Time', 'Review Everything, Test Everything' and 'Doing the Project Right Is Most Efficient' - a common theme of accountability can be identified. 
											I believe that accountability, or lack of, can be attributed to a high number of project failures. Although accountability is less specific than the 
											causes of failure highlighted in the initial study, it may be necessary to speak this broadly in order to highlight root causes effectively.
											<br>
											<br>
											Overall, the study provides a good approach to identifying causes of failure in individual projects and shows how to create some quantitative data points 
											for measurement in an otherwise subjective field. It also indicates, along with the course text, that each project must be evaluated on its own merit, 
											with focused consideration of the individual project factors. Where projects are repeated, this process becomes more easily repeatable, and I would expect 
											over several iterations of a similar project that single causes of failure can be identified. However, for most projects, it is important to review the 
											entirety of the project from scratch.

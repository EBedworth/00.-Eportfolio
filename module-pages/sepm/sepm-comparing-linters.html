									<h3>Test Code</h3>
									<p>
										The following questionable code was provided, to by run through the code quality checking tools:
										<pre><code>

import io
from math import *


from time import time

some_global_var = 'GLOBAL VAR NAMES SHOULD BE IN ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCOES'

def multiply(x, y):
    """
    This returns the result of a multiplation of the inputs
    """
    some_global_var = 'this is actually a local variable...'
    result = x* y
    return result
    if result == 777:
        print("jackpot!")

def is_sum_lucky(x, y):
    """This returns a string describing whether or not the sum of input is lucky
    This function first makes sure the inputs are valid and then calculates the
    sum. Then, it will determine a message to return based on whether or not
    that sum should be considered "lucky"
    """
    if x != None:
        if y is not None:
            result = x+y;
            if result == 7:
                return 'a lucky number!'
            else:
                return( 'an unlucky number!')

            return ('just a normal number')

class SomeClass:

    def __init__(self, some_arg,  some_other_arg, verbose = False):
        self.some_other_arg  =  some_other_arg
        self.some_arg        =  some_arg
        list_comprehension = [((100/value)*pi) for value in some_arg if value != 0]
        time = time()
        from datetime import datetime
        date_and_time = datetime.now()
        return
										</code></pre>
									</p>
									<h3>Linter Outputs</h3>
									<p>
										The first tool that the code was quality checked with was PyLint. The output from PyLint was very detailed, and contained
										more areas to be improved than any of the other tools. PyLint also provides the name of the violation and the reference
										clause, if the relevant standard needs to be checked.
										<br>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-12">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/module-img/sepm/Unit-10-pylint.png" alt=""/></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										Next, I tested with PyFlakes. PyFlakes returned significantly fewer mistakes to the terminal. The reason appears to be that 
										PyFlakes is not checking for errors such as whitespace at the end of a line, but is only really testing for coded errors. 
										You can see that all of the points reported by PyFlakes are related to variables or imports:
										<br>
										<br>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-12">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/module-img/sepm/Unit-10-pyflakes.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										PyCodeStyle seemed to be almost the opposite to PyFlakes, instead focusing on errors like whitespace usage and the number of 
										lines between code. The output format is easily readbale and consistent with both of the other tools used so far.
										<br>
										<br>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-12">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/module-img/sepm/Unit-10-pycodestyle.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										PyDocStyle is different altogether from the other three tools, and is instead examing the docstrings used throughout the code.
										It gives specific information about missing docstrings but also about the tone and personness used in the language. 
										<br>
										<br>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-12">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/module-img/sepm/Unit-10-pydocstyle.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									</p>
									<h3>Tool Comparison</h3>
									<p>
										All of these tools serve the same overarching purpose, but with specific differences that make them useful. Of the four tools 
										tested, I would say that PyLint appears to be the most 'all-rounded' tool, for checking most things in the code. If you were 
										only able to use one tool, PyLint would probably be the one to select. However, it's long output could be a bit disheartening, 
										especially with very large amounts of code, and might then encourage shortcuts to be taken. 
									</p>
									<p>
										PyFlakes and PyCodeStyle, when combined, perform a similar function to PyLint. It may be more user friendly to use one of these 
										tools very often, and fix a small number of errors, than to use PyLint and try to fix everything. This would be particularly true 
										if deviating from PEP-8 intentionally, such as to follow a particular in-house standard instead. 
									</p>
									<p>
										PyDocStyle performs a different function altogether, checking the docstrings and elements which will become the documentation. 
										Whichever of the above tools was chosen, PyDocStyle would always also be chosen to be run alongside it.
									</p>
									<p>
										Overall, it seems that the best approach to get full code coverage for errors is to use a combination of all of the tools, to ensure 
										the code is checked against as many potential errors as possible. 
									</p>

								<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2</h2>

                                <p> Our second collaborative discussion, started in Unit 5, was to read a paper by Minge & Thuring (2018) about the role of emotion on user experience, 
									with a model detailing how different parts of the user experience could be measured. We were than asked how the model could be adapted to account
									for changing emotions over time.

										<br>
										The model of the Components of User Experience (CUE) presented by Minge & Thuring (2018) in Figure 1 provides a framework for quantifying elements 
										of the user experience, but could go further in measuring how that experience develops over time. Although this model has previously been expanded 
										to include different stages of interaction with a system, such as in the User Experience Lifecycle model (Pohlmeyer et al., 2009), much of the 
										measuring of the User Experience has been derived from the feedback of the user themselves. I believe that this feedback, whilst clearly relevant 
										and valuable, intrinsically maintains the same flaws as highlighted in the original paper.
										<br>
										<br>
										The way in which I might adapt Figure 1 would be to include some objective metric based on the functionality of the system in question. An example 
										of this might be the number of button presses required to find a suitable flight on a system for booking air travel, or the time taken to find the 
										nearest store with stock for a given item on a system for advertising a range of products. This would need to be done on a system-by-system basis, 
										however, the functionality to use as a metric should be easy to identify given any knowledge of the overall intention of the development. Through 
										measuring some functionality objectively, data is provided about how successfully the user interacted with the system, something which fundamentally 
										will be of great importance to the entire user base. This is also something which could (and should) be measured over time, providing quantitative 
										data about how easily or quickly a user can learn how to use the system efficiently, or if there is no further efficiency to be found in the current 
										user experience.

                                        Following my initial post, I also read and commented on some of my peers' posts. The responses for this particular question were very similar across 
										all of the replies (mine included). Overall, the preferred approach seems to be to map the changing emotions over time and review the model with consideration 
										to those changes.

										I concluded this discussion forum with a summary post, covering what I had learned from the feedback I received and the work of my peers:

											There was a good amount of variation in the responses to how one might change the model by Minge & Thuring (2018), as well as in the wider consideration of 
											factors which affect user experience (UX). This reflects the complexity of UX and, in particular, the difficulty in measuring successful UX design. 
											<br>
											<br>
											A common theme in the answers shared within the forum was the development of human emotions over time. Several contributors felt that the development of UX 
											over time could be added to the presented model to provide a more complete picture of the UX journey. I feel as though this fits in well with my own idea 
											about including quantitative metrics, based on some specific functionality, which could also be measured over time. This would provide valuable UX information 
											about how well users were able to improve at using a system or show if the system was already as usable as possible from first exposure. These metrics have the 
											extra value of being easily comparable to similar systems, which may in turn drive greater improvement of the overall UX. 
											<br>
											<br>
											On reflection, I considered how the CUE model fitted into the overall task of evaluating UX and considered whether it was really necessary to include development 
											over time as part of this specific model. Although initially this was something that I felt fitted naturally to the model, reviewing existing approaches to long-term 
											UX evaluation (Kujala et al., 2011) made me consider that perhaps the CUE model was as simple as it need to be, as a fundamental building block of UX evaluation. The 
											presented model allows for extension and usage within a more detailed system, perhaps one that is tailored to a specific project based on the expected usage. As with 
											anything as complex as UX, it is necessary to have complex systems to measure them effectively, however, to build complex systems it is most useful to small, modular 
											components to do so. I believe that the CUE model provides this as it is presented in the article, and should remain this way to allow more nuanced systems to be 
											developed from it.

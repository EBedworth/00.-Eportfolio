									<h3 class="major">Induction Module</h3>

									<p>The induction module is a two-week module which starts prior to any computer science related modules. The intention is to familiarise us
                                        with the virtual learning environment, prepare us for academic reading, writing and research, and also to introduce the appropriate support 
                                        pathways which we might need to use during our studies. We were informed that we needed to pass the induction module in order to begin 
                                        studying the actual course.                                 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I found the learning environment really clunky to begin with. The navigation feels like it's in the wrong place, and changes depending on 
                                        what area of the site you're on, but doesn't have any headers to clearly show where you are. Writing this now after three weeks of use, 
                                        it feels more familiar, but still not great. The positive is that functionally, the VLE seems to work well for anything I've had to do so 
                                        far.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>When I started going through the materials, I was concerned about the prospect of academic writing. It has been a long time since I last 
                                        studied formally, and I don't really have any experience writing in an academic style. Fortunately, there were many resources provided
                                        which explained some information about how our writing should be done, as well as exercises in reading some academic literature which 
                                        was more useful, as it gives a clear example of how we need to structure our own work. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>There were also two pieces of work to be completed during the induction module. One was a post in a discussion forum, on the subject 
                                        'the use of e-portfolios in a postgraduate degree program', and the other was a short essay titled 'discuss the importance of a 
                                        postgraduate degree in the Computer Science field'. I started work on the discussion forum post as soon as I could, as I've committed 
                                        myself to staying ahead of where I need to be throughout this course. It seemed simple on the surface, only 250 words and some sources 
                                        were already provided. I also wanted to find some sources of my own to include, but this actually turned out to be quite difficult, 
                                        especially without a university login (this wasn't provided until after the induction module) because many sources were behind paywalls 
                                        which needed a university email address to access for free. We also didn't have library access. I ended up spending a lot of time looking
                                        for sources relevant to the point I wanted to make. I also over-thought the submission due to my previous concerns about academic 
                                        writing, and knowing we needed to pass this module to actually start the course. In the end, I submitted my post and didn't include a 
                                        reference list at the end. For some reason, I thought I didn't need to as I'd told myself these discussion forums were less formal than 
                                        an essay would have to be. It made no sense in hindsight, I'd included in-text citations and no reference list. It was pointed out by the 
                                        tutor, I felt like an idiot, but also then realised my appreciation of doing this induction module, to highlight this sort of stuff now 
                                        before the properly graded modules began. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I started working on the next assignment once I'd finished with the activities for Unit 1. Again, I felt like this should be relatively 
                                        easy because it was only 750 words, which is short, and should be something there is plenty of academic resource on. The difficulty with
                                        this assignment turned out to be that all of the resources I could find initially seemed to suggest, in a very polite way, that master's 
                                        degrees were essentially a wast of time. Obviously, that's neither how I feel nor what I wanted to include in my discussion on the importance
                                        of postgraduate degrees in computer science. After a couple of nights reading sources that were not really useful, I broke the question down
                                        further and approached the importance of postgraduate degrees more generally, then tied it to the relevance of studying computer science. I 
                                        produced something that I was happy with eventually, although it ended up taking quite a long time. I was happy to get it submitted a day 
                                        before the deadline, as it had to be submitted by the Thursday of Unit 2 (which started on Tuesday), so it was a relatively tight timeframe. 
                                        When I received it back after marking, the comments from the tutor were more critical than I'd expected, to be honest. I think that's another
                                        thing for me to get used to though, and not be sensitive about. I think proper criticism of your work is probably not very common outside of 
                                        academia (for most jobs anyway), and the criticism is helpful to me at the end of the day, so I do need to learn to appreciate it and not 
                                        be defensive. I'm sure there will be plenty more to come over the next two years.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I also read a book during this module, which was on an old reading list I found under the computing department. I'm pretty sure the list is 
                                        old anyway, as it doesn't match the reading lists which are grouped by module. The book was <i>Think OS</i>, by Robert Downey. It's available 
                                        open source, as I accessed it before I had my university login. It was useful and a fairly easy read, just covering a high-level view of how
                                        operating systems work, with reference to some C code which is also available online somewhere. I had just finished an Introduction to Computer
                                        Science course from Harvard's open courseware material, and the start of that course was in C so I had some familiarity there too. There are 
                                        a few other books in the 'Think... ' range, which I intend to read too. 
                                    </p>

									<h3 class="major">Launching into Computer Science</h3>

									<p>I was excited to start the first computer science module of the course. I spent the morning refreshing the dashboard every hour or so to 
                                        see if I had access to any of the content yet, but nothing had updated. Eventually, at around 16:00, I had an email telling me it would 
                                        be available by 17:00. As I was finishing work, I didn't manage to check again until about 20:00. I could see I had access to the module
                                        now, so I got started looking around at the content. I noticed in the 'Seminars' section that there had been a seminar at 12:00 that day. 
                                        I know we don't need to attend the seminars, but it I found it a bit annoying that the seminar had happened before I had received a login. 
                                        I emailed the tutor to explain what had happened, and he responded quickly assuring me it was no problem and that other students had been in 
                                        the same situation. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I got to work on getting my ebook downloaded. This also seemed a bit clunky to be honest, especially on my tablet. However, once I'd used 
                                        the app for a short while, it seemed fine, so I'm going to put this clunkiness down to me. I looked through the rest of the material on Unit 
                                        1, it seemed like there was quite a lot of work required this week. I had to do some reading, of which the indicative time in Moodle was 6 
                                        hours, and I had to create my e-portfolio and make a discussion forum post. I was looking forward to doing the e-portfolio anyway as it felt
                                        like the first bit of 'practical' work, so I decided to start on that. The indicative time for this was also 6 hours, which I used a quarter 
                                        of on the HTML5 UP website trying to choose which template I liked best. I didn't want to choose something everybody else would use, so I also 
                                        trawled Google looking for free HTML5 templates. Most were not really free, or not as good as the ones on HTML5 UP, so I stuck with them in the 
                                        end. I also had to set up a new GitHub account, which I used my university email address for so I could keep it separate to my personal account. 
                                        The confirmation emails didn't arrive for me to validate my account, it had been about 15 minutes, so I emailed the computing support team in case
                                        it was some inbound email policy. Then, of course, all of my validation emails arrived, as if they had been waiting for me to ask the support team 
                                        before showing up. In the end though, I had my template in a repo on my new GitHub account, ready for me to work on. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>It might have only taken 6 hours for me to make, if the guy who made the template was by chance also called Elliot Bedworth, and also had the exact 
                                        same life experience as me. I spent a long, long time making the content and styling everything just so it was consistent, not even necessarily how 
                                        I wanted it. I've already written about the making of it, so I won't go into detail here. You can see this post 
                                        <a href="../module-pages/launching-into-cs/1-eportfolio.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I then had to write the discussion post. I struggled with this, and ended up posting it on the first day of Unit 2 (so late!). I found the GDPR 
                                        documents really dry, and difficult to read. I do feel a real appreciation for GDPR too, I think it's really important and I'm glad it exists. But 
                                        I felt I had to read every line three times because it wasn't going in. I also got a bit lost trying to write my response, so I had to go back and 
                                        rewrite it. I think I wrote something interesting in the end, and I found a good study about corporate social responsibility and how employees
                                        seem more willing to follow IT policy if they believe the company they work for is ethical. Again, you can see my post on 
                                        <a href="../module-pages/launching-into-cs/2-discussion-forum.html" target="_blank">another page.</a>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The good news was that the reading didn't take 6 hours. I had to take my car into the garage, and managed to finish the reading while I was
                                        waiting for it. It was my first look at the module core text, I liked what the authors had written in the preface to the book about their
                                        approach, and I found the content good too. Will start to read more of this when I'm not reading anything else moving forward. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>In the end, I felt OK about the amount of work for this first week. It felt like I'd done some work which was significant, but would only need 
                                        to be done once (the e-portfolio mainly). I looked over some of the other students e-portfolios too and felt healthily jealous of how they 
                                        looked, so that's good encouragement to keep working on mine.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>With these journal entries, I want to add them regularly, but at this point I'm not sure on a reasonable frequency, until I'm more settled in 
                                        to the expected workload of the course. I do think it's important for me to write this down here though, as some kind of commitment to keep 
                                        on top of the journal along with the rest of the e-portfolio. I'm going to aim for every two weeks for now, and adjust as necessary. 
                                    </p>

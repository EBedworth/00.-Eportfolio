									<p>
                                        Unit 2 of <i>Launching into Computer Science</i> was about computer architecture and functionality. The learning outcomes for this week
                                        were to understand the function and characteristics of elements within a computer system and also to understand the theories around 
                                        data representation for computers.                              
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The tasks laid out for the week were reading two chapters and two appendices of the eBook (around 140 pages), reading the introductory chapter of 
                                        a book called <i>Virtual Machines</i> by James Smith and Ravi Nair (2005), contributing to the discussion forum by responding to our peers' 
                                        contributions, creating the e-portfolio (fortunately, I'd already done this) and preparation for Seminar 1 in the form of some exercises 
                                        based on the content of Unit 2.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The reading for this week felt like A LOT. 140 pages didn't seem like much, but they're textbook pages dense with information, which makes
                                        for pretty heavy reading at times. The content was interesting though, even with already knowing a decent amount about computer hardware, 
                                        the book explored the components in more detail and there was more new information than I expected. I didn't previously know about the 
                                        elements within a processor such as the ALU, so this was interesting and did make a lot of sense to me after I'd read it. Even seeing 
                                        specifically how hard disks worked, which I thought I knew already, was enjoyable. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I wasn't able to attend the seminar unfortunately, due to a work commitment. I rushed to complete the exercises for the seminar so that
                                        I could send them across anyway, as I didn't want to look like I hadn't completed them. The reason I had to rush was because the unit week
                                        starts on Tuesday, and the seminar is on Friday, but the exercises are on the subject matter for that week. So I felt as though I only 
                                        really had two days to prepare for the seminar, which isn't enough time to read all of the material for the week. I ended up looking through
                                        the reading to find the relevant sections, as well as using the internet, to complete the exercises. I've had my second seminar today as I'm 
                                        writing this and, being honest, the same thing happened again this week. I will figure out a way to prepare better for this next time. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Overall, a reasonable week. I enjoyed the content, read a lot and managed to get the work done. 
                                    </p>

									<h3 class="major">Unit 3</h3>

									<p>
                                        Unit 3 was about emerging trends in computer science, covering such topics as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Our 
                                        learning objectives were to understand the developments in computer science, including the specific technologies in use, and also to 
                                        identify the risks associated with those developments. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        For Unit 3, we had a similar amount of reading to complete from the eBook, as well as a lecturecast titled 'Emergence of New Ideas in Computing & 
                                        Networking Fundamentals'. There were also two videos on big data provided in Moodle. We were asked to contribute to the discussion forum 
                                        with a summary post, based on feedback received on our initial posts. We had to explore Google AI, which is a site by Google containing 
                                        resources for learning about AI and Machine Learning, and <a href="../module-pages/launching-into-cs/3-google-ai-tools-translate.html" target="_blank">
                                        document this in our e-portfolio</a>. Finally, we had to connect our GitHub account to Codio and follow a tutorial in Codio on how to use the environment.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I completed the reading throughout the week, in the evenings after work. This is pretty much my routine now, unless some work needs completing urgently 
                                        mid-week (like seminar activities!). I'll usually read for one or two hours a night in the week, including additional reading if I come to a point which needs 
                                        further exploration. This leaves the weekends free to do any involved work, when I can spend a better amount of time on the task. I think I also need to start
                                        doing more coding exercises in the week, to accompany the reading. I'd been doing online courses for a long time prior to starting this degree, and I haven't 
                                        done any coding other than this e-portfolio since I started. Of course, this is what Codio is for, so there are exercises there for me to complete. I had actually
                                        already connected Codio to my Github and run through the introductory assignment, which is just familiarising the user with the Codio environment. It seemed 
                                        quite intuitive, at least for the general tasks you might need to complete. I completed the introductory HTML resource too whilst I was there. The first 'proper'
                                        section is on the Linux CLI, which I have some experience with but definitely don't feel completely comfortable, so I'm looking forward to completing that. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Completing the reading, Codio HTML introduction and discussion forum posts took me the entire week. I hadn't put as many hours in as I should have this week. Not
                                        to make excuses, but work is incredibly busy from now until around November, and I'm balancing multiple large projects, which is taxing. I'd done enough to 
                                        complete the work, but I'd done probably the very minimum amount required. Very determined not to do that as much as possible in future weeks though. I realised
                                        that I hadn't completed the Google AI review, so I actually completed this in the first day of Unit 4. I have put a better amount of effort in again for Unit 4, 
                                        but I've got to try to be consistent with that for the coming weeks/months. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I enjoyed the content of Unit 3 as much as I did in Unit 2. One particular fact stuck with me, from one of the videos provided on Moodle alongside the reading 
                                        for the week. The video is available on YouTube, it's a Tedx Talk from 2013 by Kirk Borne, an astrophysicist turned data scientist, titled 'Big Data, Small World'.
                                        The fact that he mentioned came from a study from Berkeley University. The study had calculated that from the beginning of recorded human history, up until the year 
                                        2003, humanity had created about 5 exabytes (5 billion gigabytes) of data. In 2003 alone, humanity created that same amount of data again. And in 2011, that amount of 
                                        data was being created every two days. By 2013, the year this Ted Talk took place, 5 exabytes of data was being created every 10 minutes. The reason this really resonated
                                        with me, I think, is because people in my industry have been throwing around the buzzword 'big data' for a few years, and mostly it is used without substance or relevance. 
                                        I think the information in the Ted Talk really visualises what big data means, and the challenges, risks and opportunities grow in your mind from that visualisation. 
                                        This was really interesting to me, and is definitely an important emerging technology which we need to understand as computer scientists. 
                                    </p>

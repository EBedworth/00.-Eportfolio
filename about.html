									<p>I am Elliot Bedworth, a senior automation engineer currently working as Automation Manager for 
										<a href="https://www.jbtc.com/" target="_blank">JBT Corporation</a>, who are an engineering solutions provider. I work specifically 
										within the PLF product line, where we deliver packaging machinery for powder products such as infant formula and nutritional supplements. 
										I am also a student with the University of Essex, where I am studying for an MSc in Computer Science.</p>

									<p>I grew up in the midlands, living in Leamington Spa, Coventry and Warwick for various periods. In 2019, I relocated to Essex to live with 
										my partner, and we now live together in Chelmsford.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Career History</h3>

									<h4>Apprenticeship</h4>

									<p>I entered the world of engineering in 2012, joining an apprenticeship program in the automotive industry with Jaguar Land Rover. I spent 
										the first year at college full-time, learning the fundamentals of engineering as well as business improvement techniques, health and 
										safety, manufacturing processes and many other subjects. I was allocated to the 'Systems Maintenance Engineering' pathway, meaning I also 
										took practical electrical and mechanical classes. Here I learned about motors, circuitry, pneumatics, hydraulics and motion control.</p>

									<p>After this first year, I was placed into the Trim & Final Systems Maintenance team at Castle Bromwich in Birmingham. This site produced 
										exclusively Jaguar cars, and Trim and Final is the production area where the empty shell of the car enters, and leaves as a finished 
										product. I enjoyed seeing the process of this assembly, with hundreds of individual stations, each performing some small task, working 
										together to achieve this. Given the complexity of building a car, this was also the perfect environment for me to develop the skills I 
										had been introduced to during that first year of college.</p>

									<p>I spent a further three years after the initial college year as an apprentice. During this time I moved around different Trim and Final 
										maintenance teams. This mostly meant working in areas which produced different models of Jaguar, as the processes were mostly similar, 
										although there were some model-driven differences. As a maintenance engineer though, my focus was solely on machinery and automated 
										systems, as opposed to the cars themselves.</p>

									<p>There was one placement during this time which was different to the others. I spent a number of months in the Controls Engineering 
										department. This department sat one level above the maintenance department, and functioned as a kind of technical support to the 
										maintenance teams, when necessary, as well as working on Controls and Automation projects for things like changes to existing equipment, 
										or introduction of new equipment. In this department, I was introduced in some detail to PLCs (programmable logic controllers). Prior to 
										this, I had an awareness of course, as all of the machines in the production line were PLC controlled. But here, I learned about the 
										programs running in the PLCs, how they functioned and communicated. I learned about binary for the first time and how bit logic worked. 
										I also worked on a system which had been built in-house, which used Visual Basic to pull data from the PLCs and share it to a dashboard. 
										I enjoyed this placement of my apprenticeship more than any other, and after this I tried to get involved in as many Controls Engineering 
										projects as I could.</p>

									<h4>Systems Maintenance Engineer</h4>

									<p>After completing my apprenticeship, I was given a job as a Systems Maintenance Engineer, placed in one of the areas I had worked previously.
										The work remained mostly the same as it had been during my apprenticeship, although I had more responsibility and was able to work more 
										independently than when I was an apprentice. I also worked more overtime, which exposed me to more electrical installation work that couldn't
										take place when the production line was running. I continued my efforts to work on as many automation tasks as possible. A colleague and I 
										created a system based on the in-house dashboard I had been exposed to during my apprenticeship. The purpose was to provide diagnostic information 
										to maintenance engineers for an Automated Storage-Retrieval System (ASRS) which had been newly installed in the area I was working in. I used the 
										same approach as I had seen	before - creating a back-end DDE server to take data from PLCs and store it in files, which I then used to populate 
										screens on a shared dashboard. I presented the project with a colleague as part of the 'Team Improvement Circle' event, which was a company-wide 
										competition to showcase innovative ideas by local teams which had added value to the business. We reached the finals of the event, which was a 
										great acknowledgement of the work we had put in. 
									</p>

									<p>During this time as Systems Maintenance Engineer, my interest in controls engineering continued to grow. After around a year, I started to apply 
										internally for some roles which were more focused on this. 
									</p>

									<h4>Controls Engineer</h4>

									<p>I joined the Controls and Standards Engineering team as a Controls Engineer. The team were part of the Powertrain Manufacturing Engineering (PTME)
										area of the business. This was quite different to where I had worked previously. The function of PTME was to deliver new powertrain 
										facilities into the business. When I joined the team, they were at the end of a project cycle which had greatly expanded the capacity of
										the Jaguar Land Rover Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton by 850,000 square feet. We were also at the very beginning of the next
										project cycle, which was to deliver a brand-new battery assembly centre, which would be used for upcoming electric vehicle production. This
										facility is running as of 2020, located in Hams Hall in Birmingham. 
									</p>

									<p>This role had a very strong focus on machinery safety and engineering standards. I took a course with Pilz, who are a well-known industrial
										safety component manufacturer, focused on machinery safety and relevant standards to machine building. I also spent time reviewing external
										and internal standards, and understanding the requirements to build and deliver safe equipment. As I was due to be reviewing equipment
										supplied to the business by external companies, understanding these requirements was essential to the role. In addition to this, I worked
										on the new equipment which had been delivered to the Engine Manufacturing Centre, making PLC program modifications to ensure the equipment
										could communicate as required with our internal data collection systems. I was introduced to interface design documentation, and learned 
										about the importance of well-designed interfaces. I also worked to these documents, making changes where suppliers had not followed the 
										documentation as they should have. This was my first introduction to the Siemens PLC platform. Siemens are one of the two market leaders 
										in PLC systems (the other being Allen Bradley).
									</p>

									<p>As the Battery Assembly Centre project started, I focused on learning in depth about the equipment that was to be delivered. I had regular
										meetings with the main contractor for the production facility and spent a lot of time reviewing their technical proposals, including 
										electrical drawings and functional design specifications, against both international and internal standards. The PLC platform for this 
										project had been selected as Allen Bradley, which was new for PTME, although I had some experience already from my previous role, which
										gave me the opportunity to provide the team with new information. I also met with several suppliers of other industrial components, to 
										decide which equipment would be best suited to the requirements of the business. 
									</p>

									<p>Throughout this time, my partner and I had been maintaining a long-distance relationship. She lived in Essex, and I still lived in the midlands,
										so we would take turns to travel to each other at weekends. An opportunity presented itself to take voluntary redundancy at Jaguar Land Rover,
										so we decided to take advantage of it. I left Jaguar Land Rover, relocated to Essex, and entered the job market as a Controls Engineer.
									</p>

									<h4>Automation Engineer - PLF International / JBT Corporation</h4>

									<p>I started at PLF International in April 2019. I was the only permanent automation engineer when I joined, although there was a contractor who 
										had worked for the company since it was founded that I was in regular contact with. PLF was the opposite side of the coin to my role at Jaguar
										Land Rover; where previously I was working with machine builders, I was now working for one. The company was also small in comparison. There
										were around 50 people in the whole company, which turned out to be a more significant difference than I had expected. This is not to say the 
										difference was either positive or negative, but it was my first experience working for a smaller organisation and the difference was notable 
										to me. However, the PLF business had recently been purchased, shortly before my joining, by John Bean Technologies Corporation, an American 
										company who make many acquisitions in both the food and beverage industry and also in the aerospace industry. PLF were in a transitional period
										when I joined, as they moved from being a small, family-run business to being part of a larger global organisation. I think my experience 
										with Jaguar Land Rover helped the changes which were being implemented feel more familiar to me, coming from a role in a much bigger
										organisation. 
									</p>

									<p>PLF International specialise in powder filling machinery. The flagship machine is a rotary, powder-filling machine, which uses vacuum
										to fill solid containers with product. They also provided turnkey solutions, providing entire production lines with a combination of PLF 
										and external OEM equipment, integrated to form a single system for the end customer. My role was to design and develop software for the
										PLF equipment, as well as provide technical input on industrial automation activities, support modifications and service work, and configure
										automation equipment when assembled to allow the machine to run. I followed the machine from initial design through to testing with the 
										customer and eventually commissioning on-site, after installation. The role also involved international travel, which was something that
										I had been looking for in a role since I had finished my apprenticeship. I was able to travel extensively throughout Europe, as well as to 
										China and New Zealand. I gained really valuable experience working with a variety of customers, both alone and as part of a team, and my 
										technical skills developed quickly through a combination of keeping up with a high workload, working with a very broad selection of equipment, 
										and having excellent support available, particularly from the experienced contractors who were willing to share their knowledge.
									</p>

									<h4>Automation Manager</h4>

									<p>At the start of 2021, I accepted the position of Automation Manager with JBT. My role was still very much hands-on in regards to developing
										software solutions, but I was able to have more input into decision making regarding automation. I was also able to interview and employee 
										some automation engineers, which was a new experience for me professionally. I am nearly two and a half years into this role at the time 
										of writing. Most specifically from this role, I have learned about people, including myself, and how impactful personal differences can 
										be to the workplace. I have continued to work on large projects and have worked directly with people throughout all levels of the organisation. 
										This role has also helped me to develop a bigger-picture perspective to my decision making, through having greater visibility of the 
										decisions made at more senior levels of the organisation.

									<h3 class="major">Studying and Future Aspirations</h3>

									<p>Since being introduced to automation and software development as an apprentice, I have never really lost the passion I found for it. I think 
										for me, this is a result of a combination of familiarity and appreciation of computer systems, from having grown up using them, and also 
										from the idea of solving problems through creativity, which I also found when I started my career in engineering. My interest in working 
										technically with computers began, I think, when I worked on the in-house dashboard system during my apprenticeship. I was exposed to what was 
										possible using software as a construction medium. Now, in retrospect, my view was actually very narrow, and I think that probably, it still
										is. But this interest has also pushed me to learn more about computer systems, which I have done throughout my career, and has now led me here, 
										studying for a master's degree in computer science. 
									</p>

									<p>I have an idealised view of what I would like to achieve in the future from studying computer science. I would like to use software to create 
										solutions which reflect me as the creator. This is vague, and difficult to verbalise, because this exists more as a feeling than an objective 
										plan to an end goal. I also have a better understanding today of how most computer system development roles function than I did when this idea
										was conceived. However, more objectively, I know that I enjoy working with computers and software. I know that I also enjoy problem solving, 
										even when it is painful. I am sure that to develop further in the areas that I am passionate about, computer science is an essential area of 
										study. And I also know that I will never feel like I have finished with my own personal development. These are the factors which I considered when 
										applying to the University of Essex. I don't feel as though I have a specific result in mind from undertaking this master's degree, but I do feel 
										very strongly that this will be an important element of my development which will enable me to achieve <i>some</i> result that helps me.

									<h3 class="major">On a Personal Note...</h3>

									<p>As mentioned above, I live in Chelmsford with my partner, and also her mum. We have a Yorkshire Terrier named Toto. I love 
										animals and nature, and like to get out and take walks in the countryside. I sometimes play poker, and studied this for a while in the 
										hope I might improve (I didn't). I also like football and support Wolverhampton Wanderers FC, which is harder to do in person since I 
										moved away from the midlands.
